</div>

<p class="noindent center small">THE NEW BROOM.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">It</span> was soon after the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle,
in 1748, had put an inglorious end to an inglorious
war, that the Government of the day
began to give serious attention to an evil which
had been suffered to grow while public attention
was absorbed by battles abroad and the
doings of the press-gang at home.</p>

<p>This was the practise of plundering wrecked
vessels, which had been carried on in combination
with the smuggler’s daring and dangerous
trade, particularly on the wild marsh coast
south of Kent, and the equally lonely Sussex
cliffs beyond.</p>

<p>So audacious had the doings of these “free-traders”
become, that a brigade of cavalry was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
sent down into the old town of Rye, for the
purpose of overawing them, while, at the same
time, a smart revenue cutter, under the command
of a young lieutenant of noted courage
and efficiency, was despatched to cruise about
the coast, to act in concert with the soldiers.</p>

<p>It was on a windy night in early autumn,
when the sea was roaring sullenly as it dashed
against the sandstone cliffs, and echoed in the
caves and hollows worn by the waves, that a
sharp knocking at the door of Hurst Parsonage,
a mile or two from the sea-coast, made Parson
Langney look up from the writing of his
Sunday sermon, and glance inquiringly at his
daughter.</p>

<p>“Now, who will that be, Joan?” said he as
he tilted his wig on to one side of his head,
and pursed up his jolly, round, red face with
an air of some anxiety.</p>

<p>“Nay, father, you have as many visitors that
come for the ills of the body as for the health
of the soul!” cried Joan. “I can but hope
you han’t another long trudge across the
marsh before you, like your journey of a week
back.”</p>

<p>At that moment there came another thundering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
knock at the little front door, and a handful
of stones and earth was flung against
the window, followed the next moment by a
rattling of the panes.</p>

<p>Father and daughter, genial, portly parson,
and creamy-skinned, black-eyed maiden, sprang
to their feet, and looked once at each other.</p>

<p>There were wild folk in these parts, and
lonesome errands to be run sometimes by Parson
Langney, who had begun life as a surgeon,
and who had been lucky enough to be pitch-forked
into a living which exactly suited his
adventurous habits, his love of fox-hunting,
and his liking for good wine and well-hung
game.</p>

<p>Before the importunate summons could be
repeated, Parson Langney had come out of
the little dining-parlor, and drawn the bolt of
the front door.</p>

<p>For Nance, the solitary housemaid of the
modest establishment, was getting into years,
and inclined to regard a late visitor as a person
to be thwarted by being kept as long as possible
waiting at the door.</p>

<p>“Hast no better manners than to do thy best
to drive the glass from out the panes?” asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
he, as soon as he found himself face to face
with the intruder, who proved to be a sailor,
in open jacket, loose shirt and slops, and flat,
three-cornered hat.</p>

<p>“Oons, sir, ’tis a matter of life and death!”
said the man, as he saluted the parson with
becoming respect, and then pointed quickly
back in the direction of the sea, which could
be seen faintly glistening in the murky light
of a clouded moon. “I’m from the revenue
cutter in the offing yonder, where one of my
mates lies with a bullet in’s back, sent there
by one of those rascally smugglers in a fray
we’ve had with them but now. I’ve been in
the village for help, but they say there’s no
doctor here but yourself. So I beg your
honor’ll come with me, and do what you can
for him. And could you tell me of a woman
that would watch by him? For we’ve all got
our hands full, and he’ll be wandering from
his wits ere morning.”</p>

<p>The parson, without a moment’s delay, had
begun, by the help of his daughter, to get into
a rough brown riding-coat that hung from
a nail on the whitewashed wall.</p>

<p>“Why, there you have me out,” said he, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
he buttoned himself up to the chin, and put a
round, broad-brimmed black hat, with a bow
and a twisted band of black cloth, tightly on to
his somewhat rusty, grizzled bob-wig. “For
there’s none in these parts to nurse the sick as
well as my daughter Joan.”</p>

<p>“And sure I’m ready to go, father!” cried the
girl, who, with the nimbleness of a fawn, had
darted back into the parlor and brought out her
father’s case of surgical instruments, as well as
a diminutive portable chest, containing such
drugs and medicines as were in use at the time.</p>

<p>“I’ll have on my hood in a tick of the clock.”</p>

<p>And by the time these words were uttered
she had flown up the steep, narrow staircase
and disappeared round the bend at the top.
The sailor, who had stepped inside the porch,
out of the wind and a drizzling rain which had
now begun to fall, was full of admiration and
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Oons, sir, but ’twill be rough work for the
young mistress!” said he. “The water’s
washing over the boat yonder, and we shan’t
be able to push off without getting wet up to
the waist.”</p>

<p>“The lass is used to rough weather,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Parson Langney, proudly. “She’ll tell you
herself that where her father can go she goes.”</p>

<p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth
when Joan, wrapped in a rough peasant’s cloak,
and wearing a loose hood, came tripping down
the stairs.</p>

<p>Not a moment was lost. With a word to
Nance, who had put in a tardy appearance, the
parson, with his daughter on one side and the
sailor on the other, started for the shore.</p>

<p>The wind was at its worst on the top of the
hill where the Parsonage stood. A very few
minutes’ sharp walking brought them all to a
lower level, and within the shelter of a wild
straggling growth of bushes and small trees,
which extended in patches from the village
almost to the edge of the crumbling cliffs.</p>

<p>Here they struck into a rough track made
by the feet of the fishermen and less inoffensive
characters, and before they had gone far they
saw the hulk of the cutter, tossing like a little
drifting spar amid the foam of the waves, and
showing dark against the leaden, faint moonlight
on the sea beyond. The parson asked
a few questions, and elicited the usual story—a
contraband cargo was being run in a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
creek just where the cliffs broke off and the
marsh began, when the lookout man on the
cutter spied the smugglers, and a boat was
sent out to give chase. There had been a
smart brush, almost half in and half out of the
water, between the smugglers on the one
side and the cutter’s men on the other. But,
on the whole, as the narrator was forced
ruefully to admit, the smugglers had got the
best of it, as they all got away, leaving not so
much as a keg behind them, while one of the
cutter’s men had had to be carried off seriously
wounded.</p>

<p>“Zoons, and it was main odd they did get
off so well!” went on the sailor, as if in some
perplexity; “for the lieutenant himself landed
a bullet in the leg of one of the rascals, that
should have brought him down, if he hadn’t
had the devil himself—saving your presence,
mistress—to help him.”</p>

<p>In the momentary pause which followed the
man’s words, a sound suddenly came to the ears
of them all, above the whining of the wind in
the trees and bushes. It made Joan stop short
for the space of a second, and turn her eyes
hastily and furtively in the direction of a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
dell on their left, where the bracken grew high
about the trunks of a knot of beeches.</p>

<p>“Eh!” cried the sailor, stopping short, also
to listen. “What was that? ’Twas like the
groan of a man.”</p>

<p>As he turned his head to listen, the parson
and his daughter quickly exchanged a glance
expressive both of alarm and of warning. Then
the former seized the sailor by the arm, pushing
onward towards the shore at a better pace than
ever.</p>

<p>“Sure,” said he, in a deep, strong, resonant
voice that would have drowned any fainter
sound in the ears of his listener; “’tis but the
screech of a hawk. This woody ground’s alive
with the creatures.”</p>

<p>The man cast at him a rather suspicious look,
but said nothing, and allowed himself to be led
forward. So they hurried on, increasing their
pace when the ground began to dip again, until
they followed the course of a narrow and dark
ravine, which cut its way through the cliffs to
the seashore. Here they had to pick their way
over the stones and bits of broken cliff, through
which a brook, swollen by recent rains, gurgled
noisily on its way to the sea. The tide was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
going down, and the thunder of the waves,
as they beat upon the cliff’s base and echoed
in its hollows, grew fainter as they went. It
was an easier matter than they had expected
to get into the boat which was waiting to take
them to the cutter; and though the tiny craft
rose like a nutshell on the crest of the waves, and
sank into deep dells of dark water, they reached
the cutter safely, and scrambled, not without
difficulty, up the side of the little vessel, which
was anchored not far from the land.</p>

<p>A man’s voice, full, clear, musical, a voice used
to command, hailed them from the deck—</p>

<p>“Ho, there! Hast brought a doctor?”</p>

<p>“Ay, capt’n, and a parson to boot!” answered
the sailor who had been despatched on this
errand. “And a nurse that it would cure a
sick man to look at.”</p>

<p>It was at that moment that Joan, who was
as agile as a kitten, stepped on deck, and into
the light of the lantern which the lieutenant
himself was holding. The young man saluted
her, with surprise in his eyes, and a thrill of
some warmer feeling in his gallant heart. Joan
curtsied, holding on to the nearest rope the
while.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span></p>

<p>“You are welcome on board, madam.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>And the young people exchanged looks.</p>

<p>What he saw was a most fair maiden, tall
and straight, graceful with the ease and freedom
of nature and good breeding, with sparkling
brown eyes, even white teeth, and a merry
gleam belying the demureness of her formal
words.</p>

<p>What she saw was a young man only a little
above the middle height, stalwart and handsome,
with quick eyes gray as the winter sea, and
a straight, clean-cut mouth, that closed with a
look of indomitable courage and determination.</p>

<p>“And yet, madam,” the lieutenant went on,
leaving his subordinates to help Parson Langney,
who was portly, and less agile than his
daughter, up on to the deck, “they should
not have brought you. For, in truth, we are
in no state to receive a lady on board. There
has been ugly work to do with those rascally
smugglers.”</p>

<p>“I come not as a fine lady, sir,” retorted
Joan, promptly; “but as a nurse for a sick man.
There is no state needed by a woman when
she comes but to do her duty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span></p>

<p>“Well said, madam; but I thank God your
care will not be needed. The poor fellow who
was shot by those ruffians has taken a turn
for the better, and if the gentleman, whom I
take to be your father, can but perform a simple
operation for him——”</p>

<p>“My father, sir, is a most skilled surgeon,
and can perform any operation,” answered
Joan, interrupting him proudly.</p>

<p>Her look was so full of fire, the carriage of
her head, in its graceful hood, so superb, as
she uttered the ingenuous words, that Lieutenant
Tregenna smiled a little as he saluted her
and turned to the parson, who, panting and
in some disorder, had at length reached the
deck.</p>

<p>The young man introduced himself, and
they saluted each other, the parson with some
difficulty, since the continual motion of the
vessel was somewhat trying to his landsman’s
legs. Then they went below, and in a few
minutes the young man returned alone.</p>

<p>Joan had been accommodated with a seat by
the tiller, and protected from wind and water
by a tarpaulin, out of which her bonny face
peeped white in the moonlight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span></p>

<p>“You have no work for me, sir?” she asked,
as the lieutenant came up.</p>

<p>“None, madam; and even less for your
good father than we feared might be the case.
He has found the bullet, and ’twill be an easy
matter to extract it, so he says; and after that,
’tis a mere matter of a few days’ quiet to set
the poor fellow on his legs again. So the
rascals escaped murder this time; not that one
crime more or less would sit hard on the conscience
of such villains!”</p>

<p>For a moment Joan said nothing. Then
she hazarded, in a very dry, demure voice—</p>

<p>“But, sir, by what I heard, your side went
as near committing murder as the other. The
man who brought us hither spoke of a bullet
in the leg of one of the fishermen.”</p>

<p>“Fishermen! Odds my life, madam, but
that’s a very pretty way of putting it! I hope
you han’t the same kindness for the rascals
that seems to be strong among the country-folk
here! Nay, I won’t do you the injustice to
suppose you could hold their villainies in aught
but abhorrence.”</p>

<p>“Whatever is villainous I hope I abhor very
properly,” answered Joan with spirit. “And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
the shooting down of one’s fellow-men I do
hold one of the greatest villainies of all.”</p>

<p>“When ’tis done by smugglers and plunderers
of wrecks, no doubt you mean,” retorted
the lieutenant tartly.</p>

<p>“Plunderers of wrecks we have none in
these parts, or at least none that do the vile
things that were done in times past,” said she
quickly. “And if you and the soldiers that
are come to Rye had had but the punishment
of murderers and wreckers in your eye, you
would have met with more sympathy than is
like to be the case if you mean to repress
what they call in these parts free-trade.”</p>

<p>“Well, madam, ’tis in truth the repression
of ‘free-trade’ that we have in our minds, and
that we intend to carry out by the strength of
our arms. And I own I’m amazed to hear a
gentlewoman of your sense and spirit speak so
leniently of a pack of thievish persons that
live by robbing his Majesty, and, indeed, the
whole nation to which they belong. I can but
trust you speak in more ignorance than you
imagine, and that the doings of such ruffians
as one Jem Bax, and another wretch called
Gardener Tom, of Long Jack and Bill Plunder,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
Robin Cursemother and Ben the Blast have
never come to your ears.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tregenna uttered each of these
names very clearly, and with solemn emphasis,
standing so that he could see the expression
of the girl’s face as he mentioned them. To
his great disgust, he perceived that, though
she kept her eyes down as if to conceal her
feelings, she was well acquainted with all these
men, and appeared somewhat startled to learn
that he knew them so well.</p>

<p>“You have heard of these men?” he asked
sharply.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve—I’ve heard of them.”</p>

<p>“You know them, perhaps?”</p>

<p>A moment’s pause.</p>

<p>“Ye—es, I know them.”</p>

<p>“I won’t affront you by asking whether you
have any sympathy with them and their
methods. With men that live by defrauding
the revenue, and that scruple not to commit
the most violent deeds in the exercise of their
unlawful calling?”</p>

<p>The lieutenant’s tone was harsh and arrogant
as he asked these questions. Miss Joan still
sat with her eyelids down, giving him a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
view of her beauty, unconsciously proving to
him that her face was as handsome in repose,
with the black eyelashes sweeping her rounded
cheeks, as it was when her features were animated
with the excitement of conversation.
She was silent at first, and the lieutenant repeated
his last question somewhat impatiently.
There was another slight pause, however, and
then a ponderous footstep was heard creeping
up the companion-ladder.</p>

<p>“There’s my father!” cried Joan, as she
started up, in evident relief at the opportune
interruption.</p>

<p>Parson Langney, holding on valiantly to
such support as came in his way, staggered
towards them, and ended by hurling himself
against the lieutenant with so much force that
it was only by a most dexterous movement
that the younger and slimmer man escaped
being flung into the sea.</p>

<p>“I ask your pardon, captain,” cried the jolly
parson, in good-humored apology, as, with
the assistance of the young folk, he reached a
place of safety. “Remember, you’re on your
element, but I’m not on mine! Come and
dine with my daughter and me to-morrow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
and you shall see that my feet carry me well
enough on the dry land.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, sir, and I would most willingly
have accepted your kind offer, but I’m engaged
to dine with one who is, I believe, a neighbor
of yours—Squire Waldron, of Hurst Court.”</p>

<p>“Why, God bless my soul, so am I!” cried
the parson, in amazement at his own momentary
lapse of memory. “Then, sir, I shall be
happy to meet you there; and I warrant you’ll
be happy too, for the squire’s port wine, let
me tell you, is a tipple not to be despised by
his Majesty himself.”</p>

<p>“Ay, sir, and there at any rate I shall feel
comfortable in the thought that the wine has
paid duty, which, I give you my word, is what
I have not felt in any other house in the neighborhood,
public or private, since I arrived
here.”</p>

<p>But at these words a sudden and singular
alteration had occurred in the parson’s features.
He seemed to remember the office of the person
to whom he was speaking, and to become
more reserved.</p>

<p>“Ay, sir, certainly,” was all he said.</p>

<p>The lieutenant went on, with a return to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
bitterness he had shown while discussing the
subject of smugglers with Miss Joan.</p>

<p>“And as the squire is a justice of the peace,
whose duty it is to punish evil-doers, I may at
last hope, under his roof, to meet with some
sympathy with the objects of justice, such as
one expects from all right-thinking people.”</p>

<p>“Why, sir, certainly,” said Parson Langney
again, somewhat more dryly than before. And
then, turning to his daughter, he added briskly,
“Come, Joan, we must be returning. The lad
below will do very well now, sir, with quiet,
and the physic I have left for him. And I’ll
pay him another visit in a day or two.”</p>

<p>As he addressed these last words to the
lieutenant, the parson was already preparing to
lower himself into the boat which had brought
him. He seemed in haste to be gone.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tregenna then helped the young
lady down into the boat, giving her as he did
so a somewhat piqued and resentful glance,
which, however, she demurely refused to meet
with a return look from her own black eyes
until she was safely in the little boat beside her
father.</p>

<p>Then, as the small craft was tossing amidst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
the spray from the larger one, she did look up,
with the struggling moonlight full upon her
face, at the handsome young commander, on
whom a touch of youthful arrogance sat not
unbecomingly.</p>

<p>And Lieutenant Tregenna, as he saluted and
watched the little boat, and in particular its
fair occupant, was irritated and incensed beyond
measure by what he took for an expression of
merry defiance in her bright eyes.</p>

<h2 id="Ch_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent center small">A STARTLING INCIDENT.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Hurst Court</span>, where Lieutenant Tregenna
presented himself next day, by Squire Waldron’s
most obliging and pressing invitation, was
an ugly Georgian house just outside the village
of Hurst, standing in an extensive but little-cultivated
park, much of which was in a primitive
condition of gorse and tangle and unclipped,
undersized trees.</p>

<p>The mansion itself was not in the heart of
the park, but was built near the road, with
nothing but a little stretch of grass and a
wooden fence between.</p>

<p>A great baying of hounds and noise of disputing
men-servants were the sounds which
greeted the lieutenant when he arrived at the
house. Even before entering, he had formed,
both from this circumstance and from the extent
of the stables, some idea of the sort of rollicking,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
happy-go-lucky, rough country household
he was to expect; and he had scarcely set foot
inside the wide and lofty hall when the onrush
of half a dozen barking dogs, the crowding
into the hall of three or four gawky men-servants,
and the entrance of the squire himself, in a
scarlet coat, with a loud and hearty greeting on
his lips, fully confirmed this impression.</p>

<p>“Welcome, welcome to Hurst Court, lieutenant!”
cried his host, seizing him by the
hand with a grip like a blacksmith’s, and
promptly leading him in the direction of the
music-room, across a floor where a couple of
stag-hounds were lying lazily stretched out,
and between walls laden with antlers and the
grinning pates of three or four score foxes.
“You should have come a couple of hours
sooner; for the ladies have a mind to show you
their Dutch garden, and to regale you with
some music before we dine. I know not, sir,
whether such diversions are to your taste, or
whether your liking runs more in the direction
of fox-hunting and the shooting of game, as
mine does? I have no taste, myself, for your
finicking London modes; but I’m told that
the young bucks nowadays pride themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
more on cutting a fine figure in the ladies’
drawing-rooms than in sitting a horse well
and riding straight to hounds.”</p>

<p>“Nay, squire, it will give me vast pleasure
to hear the ladies’ music,” said Lieutenant
Tregenna, when his host’s volubility allowed
him the chance of answering. “’Tis a diversion
one can enjoy but seldom so far from
town.”</p>

<p>“Nay, we have better diversions here than
those,” said the squire disparagingly. “But
my wife and daughters will be prodigious
pleased that you are not of my way of thinking.
For a stranger in these parts is a mighty
welcome arrival, I assure you, and like to be
made much of.”</p>

<p>Indeed, it was quite perceptible to the lieutenant
that there was a flutter of excitement
going on in the music-room up to the very
moment of his entrance; and the welcome he
got from the squire’s wife and two daughters
was quite as sincere, though not so tempestuous,
as that of the host himself.</p>

<p>For Mrs. Waldron and the two young misses,
her daughters, were quite as much in love with
the pleasures of the town as the husband and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
father was with those of the country. And in
dress, manner, conversation, and tone they
marked the difference between themselves
and him as ostentatiously as possible.</p>

<p>Thus, while the squire wore the old-fashioned
Ramillies wig, with its bush of powdered
hair at the sides, and long pigtail tied at
the top and bottom with black ribbon, and the
loosely-fitting scarlet coat which he had worn
for any number of years, his good wife and
two round-faced, simpering daughters were all
attired in the latest modes of the town.</p>

<p>They all three wore the loose sacque or
<i>negligee</i>, which was then the height of fashion;
they tottered about in slim-heeled shoes, under
huge hoops which swayed as they walked;
while their hair was all dressed in the same
way—knotted up tightly under the smallest
and closest of caps, making their heads look
singularly small and mean, when compared with
the enormous width of their distended skirts.</p>

<p>They all seemed the most amiable of living
creatures; and Lieutenant Tregenna found at
last the sympathy he wanted when he expressed
that horror and hatred of smugglers which was
at present the ruling passion of his mind. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
squire had left him with the ladies, and he had
been entertaining them with an account of
the adventure of the preceding night.</p>

<p>“And I can assure you, madam,” he said to
his hostess, when they had hung attentively on
his words, and cried, “Wretch!” “Villains!”
“How monstrous shocking!” at appropriate
intervals, “that so deep-rooted has this evil
become, that even the parson and his young
daughter appeared to grieve more for the
smuggler whom I wounded than they did for
the poor fellow whom the ruffians shot!”</p>

<p>“His daughter! Oh, do you mean Mistress
Joan?” said Mrs. Waldron, pursing her mouth
a little. “Sure, sir, what would you expect
from a country-bred wench like that, who
tramps the villages and moors with her father
like a man, and is almost as much among these
fearsome wretches, the smugglers, as if she
were their own kin?”</p>

<p>“Oh, la, sir; you must know they call her
‘the curate,’” cried one of the young ladies,
tittering, and looking languishingly at the visitor
out of her little pink-rimmed eyes with
the whitish eyelashes; “for she’s quite as useful
in his parish as he is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span></p>

<p>“And I’m sure ’tis a very rational diversion
for a girl of her tastes,” said her sister. “You
must know, sir, that she has never seen a play,
nor any of the diversions of the town, and that
she fills up her time twittering on a dulcimer
to her father, and has barely so much as heard
of the harpsichord.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder you was affronted by her
Gothic behavior,” went on Mrs. Waldron;
“but sure ’tis very excusable in a girl who has
no polish, no refinement, and who takes no
more care of her complexion than if she was
a dairymaid.”</p>

<p>Tregenna felt considerable surprise at the
storm of reprobation which he had brought
down on the head of poor Joan. For he could
not know that the young men of the neighborhood,
and even Bertram, the squire’s son, all
showed a most boorish preference for handsome,
straight-limbed Joan, with her free bearing
and her ready tongue, over the fine ladies
of Hurst Court; and that, at the Hastings
assemblies, and at such routs as were given
in the neighborhood, Joan had more partners
than any one else, though her gown was seldom
of the latest mode, and her only fan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
was one which had belonged to her grandmother.</p>

<p>“Nay; I honor and admire her for helping
her father,” said the lieutenant, hastily. “I
did but grieve that a young lady of so much
spirit should take so wrong-headed a view of
the matter.”</p>

<p>“Your consideration is wasted upon her,
sir, indeed,” said Mrs. Waldron. “But hush!
here comes her father with the squire.”</p>

<p>There was no possibility of mistaking the
loud, deep, cheery voice of Parson Langney,
which could be heard even above the barking
of the hounds, which was the first greeting
given to every visitor. The next moment the
door opened, and Parson Langney, the squire,
and his son Bertram, entered, to be joined
a few minutes later by a couple of country
gentlemen more clownish than their host.</p>

<p>Bertram Waldron was an unhappy cross
between the country breeding of his father
and the town airs and graces of the ladies.
For while he affected the modish cut of the
town in his clothes, swore the latest oaths, and
swaggered about with a great assumption of
the manners of the beau, his rusticity peeped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
out every moment in his gait, and in his strong
provincial accent.</p>

<p>When they all trooped into the dining-parlor,
where a huge sirloin was placed smoking on
the table, it was not long before the stranger
perceived that the sympathy he had met with
from the ladies was not shared by the gentlemen.</p>

<p>Not only did they express but faint interest
in his collision with the smugglers, and profess
the greatest incredulity as to the alleged magnitude
of their operations, but by the time the
ladies had retired, it began to be hinted to him
pretty freely, as the decanters passed round,
that the less zeal he showed in the prosecution
of his raids against the “free-traders,” the more
his discretion would be respected.</p>

<p>“Gad, sir; I don’t say theirs is an honest
trade,” said the squire, whose face assumed a
purplish and apoplectic tint as the meal wore
on; “but I say that ’tis best to let sleeping
dogs lie; and that your soldiers will do a
monstrous sight more harm than good by driving
the trade into wilder parts, where the fellows
can be more daring and more dangerous.
And what I say to you, who are but a young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
man, and hot with zeal, is this: that the easier
you take things, the easier things will take you.
And if you won’t trust the advice of a man of
my experience—why, ask the parson there, and
take his.”</p>

<p>“Gad’s my life, sir; but I can take no man’s
advice who bids me do aught but what seems
to me my duty!” cried the young lieutenant
with fire. He was incensed at the laxity of
morals, which he now perceived to have permeated
to every class of society in the neighborhood.
“I’m here, under the orders of his
Majesty—the stringent orders—to put down
smuggling and the wrecking connected with
it. And what I’m sent to do, I’ll do, please
God, no matter what the difficulties in my way
may be, nor what the dangers!”</p>

<p>His words were followed by a dead, an ominous
silence.</p>

<p>The day was dying now, and the red fire
that glowed and flickered in the wide hearth
showed strange lights and shadows on the
painted ceiling, the painted and paneled walls,
the long spindle-legged sideboard, where more
wine was waiting for the jovial band at the
table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span></p>

<p>The country gentleman, one and all, looked
up at the ceiling during the pause.</p>

<p>Before any one spoke, there came to the ears
of all a sound which was easily distinguished
as the gallop of horses, accompanied by the
loud shouts of men, the cracking of whips, the
creaking of heavy wheels. Lieutenant Tregenna
who was near the window, jumped up, and
looked out, as a wagon, piled high with kegs,
and surrounded by a band of half a dozen
armed men on horseback, dashed past the
house and up the hill towards the village.</p>

<p>“Smugglers, as I live!” cried Tregenna,
much excited, and turning to attract the attention
of the rest.</p>

<p>But not a man of them moved; not one so
much as turned his head in the direction of
the window.</p>

<p>The blood flew to the young man’s brain.
“Gentlemen!” cried he, as he dashed across
the room to the door; “you will excuse me.
You, squire, are a justice of the peace; and I
must do my best to bring some of these rascals
before you, when, I doubt not, you will do your
duty towards them—and towards the king!”</p>

<p>With that he swung out of the heated room,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
seized his hat and his heavy riding-coat which
lay in the hall, and dashed down the lawn cutting
across to the left, just as a party of soldiers
came riding fast up the hill in full pursuit of
the smugglers.</p>

<p>“A d——d coxcombical puppy!” cried one
of the husky squires, as he watched the stalwart
figure of the young lieutenant making his
way rapidly past the window. “What does
he want setting up his joodgment against ours,
and presuming for to think he’s a better subject
of his Majesty than what we be?”</p>

<p>“Let ’un be! Let ’un be!” said the third
squire, grimly. “There’s no need to worrit
ourselves about him. If he doesn’t get a bullet
in his head before many days be over, why,
you may eat me for a Frenchman, and bury
my bones at the cross-roads.”</p>

<p>And the rest of the company, with only one
protesting voice, that of Parson Langney, who
said the lad had no fault but youth, and he
hoped he would come to no hurt, filled up
their glasses and smacked their lips over the
famous port, and never asked themselves
whether it had paid duty; for, indeed, there
was no mystery about that.</p>

<h2 id="Ch_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent center small">AN ALLY AT LAST.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">The</span> soldiers were rattling on in pursuit of
the smugglers at such a good pace that Lieutenant
Tregenna only reached the road in
time to see them turn the next corner and
disappear.</p>

<p>He followed, however, at the best pace he
could, hoping to be of use in finding out
the direction the smugglers had taken. He
had not yet had time to become acquainted
with the inland part of the neighborhood,
or he would have known that, by dashing
across the park in a northerly direction, he
could have reached the village before the
soldiers, who had to follow the windings of
the road.</p>

<p>As it was, when he reached the first of the
straggling cottages of the picturesque Sussex
village, the horsemen were out of sight; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
the women and children of the neighborhood
seemed to be all at their doors and windows,
evidently discussing the recent invasion with
boisterous mirth.</p>

<p>As Tregenna was not in uniform, he flattered
himself that he might go up the village unrecognized,
and perhaps obtain some scraps
of valuable information; but whether they
were better posted up than he supposed, or
whether the mere sight of a stranger awoke
suspicion in the shrewd women-folk, it was
certain that as soon as they caught sight of
him they checked their volubility, and stood,
with their hands on their hips, staring at him
with broad amusement still on their faces, or
else dropped a curtsey with demure and sudden
respectfulness, which was in itself somewhat
suspicious.</p>

<p>However, he thought he would make at
least an attempt to obtain some information.
So he addressed himself to a coarse-featured
woman who might have been any age between
twenty-five and forty-five, who stood wiping
her hands on her apron at the door of one of
the cottages, and who, by the curtsey she
dropped and the good-humored expression of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
her face, seemed to promise that she would at
least give a civil answer.</p>

<p>“Was that a troop of soldiers I caught sight
of coming into the village?” asked he, as indifferently
as possible, when he had returned
her salutation with deferential courtesy.</p>

<p>“Maybe it were, sir,” replied the woman
promptly, with demure cheerfulness; “but I
doan’t rightly know. I were out at back yonder
when I heard the noise.” She glanced out
of the corners of her eyes at an older woman
outside the door of the next cottage. “Old
Jenny yonder can tell ye more’n me, sir,” added
she slyly; “she’s been there all the toime.”</p>

<p>Tregenna, concealing the mortification he
felt, turned to Jenny.</p>

<p>But her stolid face offered little hope of
success.</p>

<p>“Ay,” said she, in a voice like a man’s,
“I’ve been sittin’ an’ standin’ about here, I
’ave, all mornin’; but I han’t seen naught.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t seen a wagon full of smugglers,
maybe, coming through at full gallop?”
cried Tregenna, losing all patience with the
mendacious females. “Nor a troop of soldiers
after them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span></p>

<p>But the sarcasm was lost upon the good
lady, who was chewing a quid of tobacco,
which he well knew to be contraband.</p>

<p>“Noa, I han’t seen aught o’ that,” she replied
imperturbably, looking him steadily in the eyes
the while. “Maybe I were in a dose, sir, or
had the sun in my eyes as they passed.”</p>

<p>He did not trust himself to speak to her
again, but went on up the village, between the
groups of straggling red cottages with their
thatched roofs overgrown with moss or lichen,
noting everywhere the sidelong looks cast at
him by such of the women as did not shut
themselves in their cottages at his approach.</p>

<p>The very urchins, chubby boys of eight and
nine, grinned at him maliciously, and helped
to give him confirmation of the fact that he
was in an enemy’s country.</p>

<p>When the ground began to rise again, at the
end of the village, he came to a point where
three roads met, and where the high hedges
and another patch of wooded ground made it
impossible to see far in any direction. As all
three roads were in a most villainous condition,
with deep ruts and pools and furrows of caked
mud, and as all three bore marks of horses’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
hoofs the lieutenant knew that it was useless
to go further. So he returned through the village
in a highly irritated state of mind.</p>

<p>The excitement had subsided a little by this
time, and most of the gossips had resumed
their household occupations. There was a
group of suspicious-looking loafers about the
door of each of the two inns; but although it
seemed to Tregenna that the word smuggler
was writ large across the bloated features of
every one, there was nothing to be done but to
look as if he ignored their existence.</p>

<p>Thus, in the very worst of humors, he again
reached the entrance of the village, and, after
a moment’s hesitation, struck up to the left in
the direction of the Parsonage, at the garden
gate of which he saw handsome Mistress Joan
in conversation with another woman.</p>

<p>He was still ostensibly bound on a mission
of inquiry, yet it is doubtful whether he hoped
to get much information from Joan, who had
clearly shown herself to be one of the enemy.
Still he strode up the hill with a resolute step,
and saluted her in the most abrupt, business-like,
and even somewhat offended manner.</p>

<p>“Your pardon, Mistress Joan, for intruding.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
But ’tis in the performance of my duty. Can
you inform me whither the smugglers be gone
that rode by just now with the soldiers after
them?”</p>

<p>“How should I be able to tell you that, sir?
Do you take me for a smuggler myself?” asked
Joan, demurely.</p>

<p>He did not at once answer. The girl looked
even handsomer, so it seemed to him, in the
dying light of day than she had done by the
light of moon and lantern on the preceding
evening. The creamy tints of her skin melted
into bright carnation on her cheeks; and he
thought, with a flash of amusement, of the strictures
of the powdered and painted ladies of
Hurst Court upon her rustic complexion. Her
dress, too, pleased his taste better than theirs
had done. She wore neither hood nor cap, and
her abundant brown hair was rolled back from
her forehead in a style which was at that period
somewhat old-fashioned, but which gave infinitely
more dignity to the head than the
tightly screwed-up knot of the fashionable
ladies. She wore no hoop or next to none, and
her full skirt, of some sort of gray homespun,
fell in graceful folds around her. A long fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
white apron reached to the hem of her dress,
and her bodice was adorned with a frilled kerchief
of soft white muslin, and with full gathers
of muslin just below the elbow. The dress was
neat, simple, eminently fresh and becoming.</p>

<p>Perhaps Tregenna’s masculine eye did not
take in all these details; but he was conscious
that the whole effect was pleasing beyond anything
feminine he had ever seen, and vastly
superior to the modish charms of the Hurst
Court ladies. He gave himself, however, little
time for these reflections before a glance at the
house behind her suggested to him a thought
which he immediately put into the most matter-of-fact
words.</p>

<p>“You stand high here, madam; that tower to
the east of your house will give you a view over
many miles. Will you favor me with your permission
to go up thither for a few minutes, that
I may take a reconnaissance of the country?”</p>

<p>By the startled look which instantly came
into Joan’s gray eyes, by the crimson flush
which mounted to her forehead, Tregenna saw,
to his intense annoyance, another proof that her
sympathy with his foes went beyond the passive
stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, you can’t go into the tower, sir; at
least——” She hesitated a moment, evidently
looking for an excuse, and then went on—“at
least, in my father’s absence. If you will come
hither to-morrow, or—or——” Tregenna noticed
that at this point she sought the eyes of
the woman with whom she had been talking, and
who had withdrawn respectfully to a distance
of some paces on his approach. “Or the day
after. ’Tis a fair view, certainly, when there’s
no mist on the marshes; but hardly worth the
trouble of climbing our staircase, which is
encumbered by much lumber of my father’s,”
she ended somewhat lamely, but recovering
her composure.</p>

<p>Tregenna did not at once answer, but he
glanced at the house with a scrutinizing eye.
The western portion of the building, which
was most modest in dimensions, had been the
banqueting-hall of a mansion as far back as the
time of King John. It had since that time
gone through many vicissitudes, and was now
divided into small chambers, with the ancient
king-post of the banqueting-hall spreading its
wide beams through the upper story. On
the east side of the dwelling an addition had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
been made, taller than the more ancient
portion, and crowned by a gabled roof of red
tiles.</p>

<p>Over the whole house there hung a rich
mantle of glossy dark ivy, which had grown
into a massive tree over the more ancient part,
and stretched its twining branches as far as
the higher roof of the newer portion, leaving
little to be seen of the structure but the windows,
the knotted panes of which glistened like
huge dewdrops in the setting sun.</p>

<p>Tregenna drew himself up. He took it for
granted she did not intend him to use the Parsonage
as a watch-tower, to descry the course
the smugglers had taken.</p>

<p>“You are afraid, I suppose,” said he sharply,
“that I might find out the direction in which
lie the haunts of ‘free-trade?’”</p>

<p>Joan drew herself up in her turn. “Nay,
sir,” said she quietly, “those haunts are
reached by now, I doubt not; and your friends
the soldiers will ere long be returning.”</p>

<p>“May be with a few of <i>your</i> friends, the free-traders,
at their saddle-bow, madam,” retorted
the lieutenant hotly.</p>

<p>“Sir, you are insulting,” said Joan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span></p>

<p>“Nay, madam, there is no inference to be
drawn from your speech and behavior in this
matter but the one I draw.”</p>

<p>“I wish you a good evening, sir,” replied
Joan, as, flashing upon him one look of indignant
pride from her great brown eyes, she made
him a most stately curtsey, with her arms
folded across and her head erect, and sailed
back into the house between the holly-bushes
and the clipped yews.</p>

<p>There was nothing for Tregenna to do but to
retire, after having returned her curtsey with
a deep bow of corresponding stiffness. As
he turned to descend the hill, he had to pass
the woman who had been talking with Joan,
and who had made way for him to converse
with the young lady. He glanced at her in
passing, but noted only that she was apparently
of the small-farmer class, youngish rather
than young, with a quiet, stolid country face,
and sinewy, rustic hands and arms.</p>

<p>Her dress was that of her class, consisting
of a thick dark stuff skirt drawn through the
placket-holes, a coarse white apron, frilled
white cap, a kerchief knotted on the breast, and
long close mittens. She wore buckled shoes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
with stout heels, and carried a big basket on
her arm.</p>

<p>There was altogether nothing more remarkable
about her than an air of extreme cleanliness,
neatness, and dignified respectability.</p>

<p>She dropped a curtsey to the gentleman as
he went by, which he returned with a touch
of the hat and a curt “Good evening.” He
was in no mood for any unnecessary exchange
of civilities; for he judged by the glance Joan
had thrown in the direction of this woman that,
demurely respectable as she looked, she shared
the universal sympathy with the wrong-doers
whom it was his mission to root out of the
land.</p>

<p>He had scarcely reached the bottom of the
hill by the lane which formed an acute angle
with the village street, when the soldiers, with
the brigadier at their head, came trooping
slowly through the village on their return
journey. Alas! they had no captured outlaws
at their bridle; they looked tired, hot, dispirited;
their commander was swearing lustily,
after the military fashion of the times; and
the women of the village, keen-witted enough
to guess that the squadron would be in an ill-humor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
kept within doors, and satisfied their
curiosity by furtive peeps from behind the
drapery of their windows.</p>

<p>The brigadier perceived the lieutenant, called
“Halt,” in a guttural voice, to his men, and
proceeded to unfold his grievances, with a
plentiful interlarding of strange oaths.</p>

<p>It was the old story that Tregenna knew so
well: nobody had seen the smugglers; nobody
had heard them; nobody had the least idea
that there were such people about, or could
give a suggestion as to the way they had
gone.</p>

<p>“Ods my life, sir, we got to the river through
following what I took for their trail; but there
was no bridge, and I knew no means of getting
across it, since the water appeared to be high
and the stream swift. So, sir, the d——d
rascals may e’en be at t’other end of the county
by this, and curse me if I see how they’re to
be got at, when every wench and every child
in the place is on their side—damme!”</p>

<p>While he thus railed on, Tregenna became
suddenly aware that he had an attentive listener
in the person of the respectable-looking woman
with the basket, who had evidently followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
the lieutenant down the hill, and who now
stood close to the bridle of the brigadier’s
charger, whose nose she presently began to
caress with her broad brown hand.</p>

<p>The brigadier, incensed by what he considered
a piece of gross impertinence on the
part of one of the country-folk, drew back his
horse with a jerk, and uttered an oath, bursting
the next moment into a not very refined reproof
for her temerity. The woman remained
however entirely unmoved by it, and as the
horse retreated, she followed him up, until
she again stood close to the bit he was
champing.</p>

<p>“May I make so bold as give him a drink
of water, sir?” asked she, in a pleasant, deep
voice, with less of the rough country accent
than one would have expected from her.
“Sure you’ve had a long, hard ride, and one
should be merciful to one’s beast.”</p>

<p>Tregenna glanced at her with more interest
than before. When she spoke, there was a
certain quiet authority about her, most proper
to the mistress of a farmhouse; and he perceived
that she was younger by some years
than he had supposed, not more than eight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
and twenty perhaps, and that her features,
though not handsome, had a homely attraction
of their own when animated by the action of
speaking.</p>

<p>The brigadier, who, true to his profession,
looked upon himself as a rake of the first water,
cocked his hat, put his hand to his side, and
leered at her with a roguish air, which was, in
truth, not so fascinating in a gentleman of his
portly build and purplish complexion as he
fancied.</p>

<p>“You wenches in these parts are kinder to
the beasts than to their riders, egad!” said he,
with a shake of the head that set his bob-wig
wagging merrily. “You don’t offer me a
drink; and if I was to beg such a favor of
you as a word to tell me where to find the
smugglers, I’ll be sworn you’d give me a stare
like the rest of ’em, and vow you’d never heard
of the creatures!”</p>

<p>The woman listened to him with modest
gravity, her face quite stolid, her eyes on the
horse. Then she said, in a quiet, even tone,
without either prudery or coquetry, but with an
air of being much interested by what he said—</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I’m not going to tell you that.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
I know to my cost the things that go on in
these parts, and that there’s many a man ruined
for an honest calling by being drawn in with
these folks. You see, sir, it be in the air, and
they breathe it in from childhood up, so to
speak.”</p>

<p>“That’s it; that’s it, my good woman!”
cried the brigadier enthusiastically. “Egad,
my lass, you’re the first person I’ve met in these
parts to admit even so much. Now tell me,
think you not ’twould be better for you all if
this thing, this free-trade, as they falsely call
it, was rooted out?”</p>

<p>“Ay, sir, I do think so,” said the woman
earnestly. “And if I thought you’d do your
work without too rough a hand, I’d lead you to
their haunts myself.”</p>

<p>“You would? You would?” cried the brigadier,
with great eagerness. “Well, then,
you may rely on me. If you’ll but take me to
the spot where they harbor, I’ll be as gentle
as a lamb with the ruff—I should say, with the
poor misguided fellows.”</p>

<p>“Come, sir, then, with me,” said the woman,
as she at once began to lead the way back
through the village at a smart pace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span></p>

<p>The brigadier turned his horse, and commanded
his men to follow, and in a few minutes
every horseman was again lost to sight at
the bend of the road.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tregenna, who had heard this
colloquy, had been inclined to think, from the
woman’s manner, that in her indeed they had
got hold of a decent-minded person who had no
sympathy with the thieves.</p>

<p>But happening to glance up at the latticed
window under the eaves of the nearest cottage
he caught sight of two faces, a man’s and a
woman’s, in convulsions of laughter. A cursory
examination of such other windows as were
near enough for him to see revealed similar
phenomena.</p>

<p>And the question darted into his mind:
Was the respectable-looking woman a friend of
the smugglers? And was it her intention to
lead the soldiers into an ambuscade?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span></p>
<h2 id="Ch_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent center small">FRESH OUTRAGES.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Tregenna</span> debated with himself whether he
should run after the brigadier and put him on
his guard. But a moment’s reflection convinced
him that a word of warning from a young man
like himself would be received with resentment
rather than with gratitude by the old soldier.
After all, the soldiers were well armed, and
were presumably prepared for emergencies.</p>

<p>So he turned his back on the village, and
made his way over the cliffs to the creek where
the gig was lying to take him to the cutter.</p>

<p>It was at the mouth of the little ravine down
which Parson Langney and his daughter had
gone on the preceding evening.</p>

<p>It was dark in this cleft between the sandstone
hills, dark and cool, with a breeze that
rushed through from the sea and whistled in
the scrubby pines and through the arching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
briers of the blackberry bushes. The stream
which flowed swiftly down, making little trickling
waterfalls from rock to rock, was swollen
by recent rains, and made little patches of morass
and mire at every few steps. The lieutenant
found the water over his ankles half a dozen
times on his way down. He had just come in
sight of the opening where the gig lay when,
drawing his right foot out of a mossy swamp
that squelched under his tread, he saw, with
a sudden chill, that his boot was dyed a deep,
murky red.</p>

<p>Scenting another outrage, he uttered an exclamation,
and looked about him. Trickling
down the side of the ravine into the mud and
water of the little patch of swamp was a dark
red stream—and the stream was blood.</p>

<p>He uttered a cry, a call; no one answered.
The next moment he was scrambling up the
side of the ravine.</p>

<p>At the top, lying in a patch of gorse that
fringed the edge of the broken cliff, was the body
of a coastguardsman, his head nearly severed
from his body, and with the blood still oozing
from the ghastly wound which had killed him.</p>

<p>The poor fellow’s hands and limbs were ice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
cold; he had been dead some time. A sheath-knife,
such as sailors use, apparently the
weapon with which the murder had been
effected, lay among the bushes a few paces
off.</p>

<p>The lieutenant ground his teeth. Not thieves
alone, but murderers, were these wretches
with whom the whole country-side was in
league. He picked up the knife, with the
dried blood upon it; there was a name
scratched roughly on the blade, “Ben Bax.”
It was a name new to Tregenna, and strong
as the clue seemed, it inspired him with but
faint hopes of bringing the murderer to punishment.
The whole neighborhood would
conspire to shield the author of the outrage;
the very fact of the knife, with the name on
it, having been left behind, showed with what
cynical impunity the wretches went about their
work.</p>

<p>However, here was at last a deed which not
even Squire Waldron could excuse, not even
Joan Langney could palliate. The man was
dead; there was nothing to be done for him.
But information must be given of the murder
without delay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span></p>

<p>Tregenna was near enough to the gig to
hail the men in charge of it, and these hurried
up to the spot without delay.</p>

<p>They knew of the raid, but not of the murder.
During the lieutenant’s absence a suspicious-looking
sloop had been sighted at anchor
some little distance away. A watch had been
kept upon her from the cutter, and a boat
seen to push off and make for the marshes.</p>

<p>The cutter’s crew had manned a boat and
given chase, only to find that they had been
drawn off in pursuit of a decoy craft, containing
nothing contraband, while the men remaining
on the cutter had the mortification to see
a second boat, piled high with kegs and full
of smugglers armed to the teeth, row up the
creek, land crew and cargo, and then return
to the sloop, exchanging shots with the cutter’s
men, without effect on either side.</p>

<p>The cutter’s men, however, had seen nothing
of the murder, for the irregularities of the
ground and the scrubby undergrowth of gorse
and bramble had hidden the struggle from
their sight, though, but for this circumstance,
the spot would have been within the range of
their telescopes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant Tregenna lost not a moment in
returning to Hurst, to report the outrage to
Squire Waldron, whose lenity could not afford
to excuse such a barbarous act as this on the
part of his free-traders.</p>

<p>He went by the shortest way this time,
taking the foot-track over the hills, by which
Parson Langney and his daughter had come
on the previous night.</p>

<p>Perhaps the ghastly sight he had just witnessed
had sharpened his faculties; for before
he had gone far over the worn grass of the
path he caught sight of some marks which
arrested his attention. Stooping to look at
them, and then kneeling on the short turf,
peering closely at the ground, he soon satisfied
himself that the marks were bloodstains, and
that they followed the course he was taking.</p>

<p>Feeling sure that he was on the track of
another piece of the free-traders’ sanguinary
work, he went back on his steps, and traced
the bloodstains to a thicket by the side of the
footpath, where there were traces, in broken
branches and down-trodden bracken, of the
wounded creature, whether man or animal,
having hidden or rested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span></p>

<p>And then it flashed suddenly across his mind
that it was near this spot that the smuggler
must have stood at whom he himself had, on
the previous evening, fired with what he had
believed at the time to be good effect.</p>

<p>If this were so, and if this were the trail
of the wounded man, he might be able, by
following it up, to find at least one of the
guilty fraternity, and bring him to justice.</p>

<p>Fired with this belief, which was like a ray
of golden hope in the black despair which had
been settling on him, he turned again, and
following the track of the bloodstains, which
were dry, although evidently recent, he went
steadily on in the direction of Hurst, looking
always on the ground, and not noticing at
first whither the track was leading him.</p>

<p>It was with a start and a sudden chill that
he presently recognized, on raising his head
when the ground began to rise, that it was to
the Parsonage that the marks led.</p>

<p>To the Parsonage—where he had stood talking
to Joan Langney that afternoon! For a
moment he felt sick, and faltered in his purpose.
He did not want to bring shame, disgrace,
upon that house of all others. Yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
what was to be done? If she and her father
were indeed harboring one of the ferocious
pack with whom he and his men had been in
conflict on the preceding night, why should
he hesitate to accuse them of the fact, and to
demand that the rascal should be handed over
to justice?</p>

<p>He was sorry to have to do it, almost passionately
sorry; for even Joan’s prevarication,
her defense of the outlaws, her defiance of
himself, had not availed to destroy the admiration
he felt for the handsome, fearless maiden
who was her father’s right hand, and who was
ready to dare all dangers in the cause of what
she considered her duty.</p>

<p>But, then, there was his own duty to be
considered. And that demanded that he
should seize the smallest clue to the authors
of the outrages which followed one another
thick and fast, and showed an almost inconceivable
audacity on the part of the smugglers.</p>

<p>He marched, therefore, after a few minutes’
hesitation, boldly upwards, and following the
track of the bloodstains still, found himself,
in a few minutes, not at the front of the house,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
where he had been that morning, but at a
garden-gate at the back.</p>

<p>He lifted the latch and entered. The bloodstains
were faintly visible in the dusk, on the
gravel of the path that took him up to the
back door of the house.</p>

<p>And there, on the very doorstep, was a keg
of contraband brandy.</p>

<p>The sight of this gave Tregenna fresh nerve;
and he knocked with his cane loudly at the
door.</p>

<p>It was opened by Joan herself.</p>

<p>It was almost dark by this time; but he saw
the look of horror and dismay which flashed
across her face when she saw who her visitor
was. Her glance passed quickly to the keg
on the step below, but only for a moment.
Then, without appearing to notice that very
suspicious article, she addressed Tregenna,
not discourteously, but with decided coldness.</p>

<p>“What is your pleasure, sir? Are you come
to see my father? He is not yet returned.”</p>

<p>“I am not come to see your father, madam,
but another person who is harboring beneath
this roof; the smuggler who is taking refuge
here from the consequences of his ill deeds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span></p>

<p>She was taken by surprise, and the look
which crossed her candid face betrayed
her.</p>

<p>“’Tis in vain for you to deny it, madam,”
pursued Tregenna, boldly, “for I have proof
of what I say.”</p>

<p>There was a short pause, and then Joan said
steadily—</p>

<p>“I do not deny it.”</p>

<p>Certain as he had felt of the truth of his
surmise, Tregenna felt that his breath was
taken away for a moment by this cool confession.
He was shocked, grieved, through
all the triumph he felt at having, as he thought,
at last run his prey to earth.</p>

<p>“You deny not, madam,” he went on, in an
altered voice, “that you have beneath your
roof a thief, and if not a murderer, at least an
associate and accomplice of murderers?”</p>

<p>“A murderer! No, I will not believe that,”
cried Joan, warmly.</p>

<p>“Well a smuggler, if that name please you
better, though in truth there’s mighty little
difference between them. I am come, then,
madam, to see this smuggler, and to endeavor
to find out whether he is the man that cruelly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
stabbed to death a poor coastguardsman but
a couple or so of hours ago.”</p>

<p>“It was not he,” said Joan, hastily. “He
hath been here since last night.”</p>

<p>“Ah! then he was engaged in the fight
with us last night; and ’twas he, doubtless,
whom I shot in the leg as he got away.”</p>

<p>“And is not the wound, think you, sir,
a sufficient injury to have inflicted on him,
that you must relentlessly track him down for
fresh punishment?”</p>

<p>“Madam, ’tis no matter of personal feeling;
’tis in the king’s name, and on the king’s behalf,
I charge you to give him up to justice.”</p>

<p>“Then, in the name of justice and of
humanity, I refuse!” said Joan, passionately,
as she threw her handsome head back, and
fixed upon him a look of proud defiance.
“The man who takes shelter in my father’s
house, should be safe there, were he the
greatest criminal on earth; and how much
more when he comes bleeding from a wound
inflicted by the men who should be our protectors!”</p>

<p>Exasperated as Tregenna was by the difficulties
which she put in his way, he could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
help admiring her spirit. He answered more
mildly than he would have done had her defiant
speech been uttered by another mouth—</p>

<p>“Nay, madam, you will not suffer us to
protect you from the wrong-doers and their
works; you side with them, against us and
the law!”</p>

<p>“Who is that talks of the law?” cried a
cheery voice from the narrow hall behind Joan.</p>

<p>And Parson Langney, in a very genial mood,
having but just returned from Hurst Court
and the merrymakers there, presented himself
at the doorway where his daughter made way
for him.</p>

<p>“You have a smuggler here, sir, whom I beg
you to give up to justice,” said Tregenna. “I
can prove that he hath taken a foremost part
in a raid and a fight with my men; and sure
Miss Joan may rest satisfied with what you
have done for him, and let justice take its
course now.”</p>

<p>The parson glanced at his daughter with a
change of countenance—</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, “the soldiers are at Hurst
Court; bring them hither, and make a search
of my house, if you please. You will find but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
a poor fellow that lies sick with a wound in his
leg. I fear me poor Tom will never live to
take his trial if he be moved from where he
lies with the fever that is on him now.”</p>

<p>“He shall be used with all gentleness, sir,
I promise you. And sorry am I to have to
intrude upon you and your kind charity in
this manner. But you are aware, sir, that I
must do my duty.”</p>

<p>“Ay, sir, as we do ours,” replied the parson,
sturdily. “We ask not what a man has done
when he comes to us for help. We ask but
what we can do for him, be he friend or be he
foe.”</p>

<p>“I know it, sir. I have experienced your
kindness—and Mistress Joan’s.”</p>

<p>The young lady now stood a little in the
background, looking anxious and perturbed.
She hardly glanced at him when he uttered
her name.</p>

<p>“You will pardon me, sir, for being forced
to incommode you thus.”</p>

<p>“You must do your duty, sir,” retorted Parson
Langney, dryly.</p>

<p>“And you will admit us when we come with
a warrant?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span></p>

<p>“Ay, sir.”</p>

<p>Tregenna bowed and withdrew. Halfway
down the garden path he heard a noise behind
him, and turned. Parson Langney was busy
rolling the keg of brandy into his house. On
meeting the lieutenant’s eyes, the parson,
hardly pausing in his labor, sang out with
much simplicity—</p>

<p>“’Tis but the physician’s fee, sir. And sure,
the laborer is worthy of his hire!”</p>

<p>And with that, he gave the keg a final roll,
got it within doors, and drew the bolt.</p>

<h2 id="Ch_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent center small">A LOAD OF HAY.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Lieutenant Tregenna</span> was quite prepared
to find the gentlemen at Hurst Court in a very
merry mood, after the hours which they had
spent at the dinner-table since his abrupt
departure.</p>

<p>He sent in his message that his business was
urgent, and chose to wait in the great hall,
with the staghounds sniffing about his ankles,
rather than have to discuss small-talk with the
ladies, as the old butler wished him to do.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Squire Waldron, not very
steady as to gait, or clear as to utterance, came
out of the dining-parlor, followed by the
brigadier, who was less coherent still.</p>

<p>The news of the murder of the coastguardsman,
however, startled them both into sobriety;
and the squire made less difficulty than Tregenna
had expected about making out a warrant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
for the apprehension of the one man whom he
had tracked down.</p>

<p>“What’s his name, say you?” asked the
squire, who had conducted his companions
into the study, through the walls of which they
could hear the stertorous snoring of the other
guests, who had fallen asleep, whether upon or
under the table Tregenna could only guess.</p>

<p>“I know only that he is called Tom,” replied
Tregenna, who remembered that the parson
had uttered that name.</p>

<p>“Ah, then ’twill be ‘Gardener Tom,’ as they
call him, as fine a lad as ever you clapped eyes
on,” almost sighed the squire, as he began to
make out the warrant, not without erasures, in
a decidedly ‘after-dinner’ handwriting. “Poor
Tom, poor Tom! You will not have him
moved to-night, general, and jolt a man in a
fever across the marshes to Rye?”</p>

<p>“Egad, squire, since he will certainly be
hanged, what signifies a jog more or less to
his rascally bonesh?” retorted the brigadier
ferociously.</p>

<p>The warrant made out, and the soldiers
summoned from the servants’ hall, where they
had been regaled by the squire’s command, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
lieutenant and the brigadier took leave of their
host, and started from the house without loss of
time, Tregenna keeping pace on foot with the
officer’s charger, while the soldiers followed.</p>

<p>The brigadier was in the highest spirits, and
was inclined to look down upon Tregenna’s
capture, and upon his methods of work.</p>

<p>“’S’no use, my lad, no mortal use,” he said,
laying down the law with vigor, and trying
to sit straight upon the saddle so that his gesticulating
arm should not overbalance him,
“to try t’ get on in anything without th’ women!
Now, I alwaysh make up to th’ women!” he
went on, with a wink and a roguish leer; “and
they’re going to pull me through thish time,
as they’ve done a hundred timesh afore! Did
you see me with that lass?” he went on, resting
his hand upon his hip, and cocking his
hat knowingly. “That lass that went up the
village with me?”</p>

<p>“A decent-looking woman, that has the appearance
of a farmer’s wife or daughter?” said
Tregenna, somewhat dryly.</p>

<p>“Ay, that’s she. Name’s Ann Price, keepsh
house for her brother, who’s a farmer living
a little way inland yonder. Forget name of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
place. Squire told me all about her. Fine
woman, sir; doosed fine woman; sh’perior
woman, too, monstrous sh’perior. She’s going
to put me on the track of the beggars;
took me up the hill, and showed me the way
to one of their haunts, that she did, sir.
Though in these parts one wouldn’t have
thought she’d ha’ dared do it, sir; and she
wouldn’t if I hadn’t known how to wheedle it
out of her!”</p>

<p>“You don’t think, general, she was playing
you false?”</p>

<p>“False! No, sir. I’m too devilish artful
to be played tricks with. No, sir; I played
with her as a cat plays with a mouse, and led
her on so far that she can’t draw back. She is
to come and see me at my quarters in Rye
next market day, and—” he paused a moment
to give a fatuous chuckle—“if I don’t get out
of her afore she goes back every damned thing
I want to know, why, sir, then they may court-martial
me for a d-d-d-damned blunderer, sir!”</p>

<p>Tregenna did not attempt to betray further
his doubts as to the woman’s good faith. But
when they reached the angle where the road
through the village was joined by the by-road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
up to the Parsonage, and he saw a woman’s
figure which he thought he recognized at the
door of one of the cottages, he dropped behind,
and let the brigadier, who had the warrant,
and the soldiers, go up to the Parsonage without
him.</p>

<p>As he had supposed, the woman who had attracted
his attention proved indeed to be Ann
Price, who now wore a long round cloak of full
pleats, with a hood attached to it, and who
appeared to be waiting for some one.</p>

<p>It was so dark by this time that the poor
oil-lamp over the door of the little thatched
inn opposite made a small patch of light in
the miry roadway; into this patch, while
the woman still stood waiting, and Tregenna
watched her, came, reeling from the inn-door,
a tall, brawny, muscular man, in a rough fisherman’s
dress, wearing on his head the long,
knitted, tasseled cap of his kind. He had a
couple of huge pistols stuck in his belt, which
showed under the flaps of his loose, open coat;
and his whole appearance betrayed the unmistakable
fact that he was no peaceful seafarer,
but an active participator in the contraband
trade of the neighborhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span></p>

<p>Crossing the road with an unsteady gait, and
uttering the while a chuckling, coarse laugh, he
made his way towards the woman, who, by a
quick movement, avoided his close approach.</p>

<p>“Why, Ann, my lass, what’s to do that thou’rt
grown too nice to give a greeting to a friend,
and thy cousin to boot? Is’t for yon knave
Tom thou’rt grieving? Ods life, but he’s no
fit match for thee; thou’lt never wed with a
landsman, thou, when there’s a better man
ready, eh, lass?”</p>

<p>And with that he steadied himself, ran
towards her, intercepted her as she would have
gone through the alley between the cottages,
and seized her roughly by the cloak.</p>

<p>“Coom, lass, no airs with me!” he said, in
an angry tone, as she tried, to wrench her
cloak away from his grasp. “Thou canst keep
thy coyness for the soldier-chaps.”</p>

<p>“Have done, Ben!” cried Ann, imperiously,
but in a low voice. “Dost want to have the
soldiers after thee? They’re nigh enough!”</p>

<p>“What care I for the fules in red? or thou
either, cousin Ann? Come, now, one kiss,
lass, and I’ll be gone.”</p>

<p>Seeing that the man, who was a hulking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
rascal some six feet high, and broad in proportion,
was plainly preparing to take by force what
he could not get by coaxing, Tregenna hurried
up to rescue the woman from her too persistent
admirer.</p>

<p>To his surprise, however, before he came up
with the disputants, Ann suddenly struck out
with her right fist straight from the shoulder,
caught the unsteady Ben unawares, and landed
him flat on his back in the mud in the middle
of the road.</p>

<p>“Well done!” cried Tregenna, involuntarily
below his breath.</p>

<p>“Get up, Ben!” cried Ann, as it were apologetically,
and without the least resentment.
“Thou shouldst not ha’ crossed me, lad.”</p>

<p>Ben was sitting up, and swearing the most
appalling oaths. Perceiving Tregenna, and
hearing his ejaculation, he was seized with
a sudden access of brutal ferocity; and with
a yell of rage he clapped his hand to his belt,
drew out one of the huge pistols he wore, and,
pointing it at the lieutenant, would have fired
at him, if Ann had not sprung into the middle
of the roadway with astounding agility, and
jerked up the weapon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span></p>

<p>“Up, up!” cried she, in a low voice; “up
and begone. You must do no more mischief
to-night.”</p>

<p>Ben continued to swear, but he obeyed her,
getting up slowly and with difficulty, and meekly
suffering her to strip off his coat, which she
put into his hands, telling him to get the hostess
of the Frigate to cleanse it for him. This
command also he took with docility; but once
more catching sight of Tregenna as he turned
to re-enter the inn, he shook his fist at him,
and growled out something which sounded
like a threat of settling arrears between them
on some future occasion.</p>

<p>When he had disappeared within the hospitable
doors of the Frigate, whence issued a
great noise of singing, shouting, and hoarse
laughter, Ann turned with some appearance
of impatience to the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Why are you not with your friends, the
soldiers, searching the parson’s house, yonder?”
she asked shortly.</p>

<p>He did not tell her the truth, that he was
suspicious of her, and was keeping watch on
her movements, wondering for whom she was
waiting. He only said—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span></p>

<p>“There are enough of them to perform that
simple office. And I am loath to incommode
Mistress Joan, by forcing upon her more intruders
than can do the task there is to do.”</p>

<p>“Nay, then, you should return to your ship,
sir; for there be a wild sort of characters about
to-night, and none too sober. Your person is
known, too, and you may chance to get a bullet
through you, which will further neither the
king’s cause nor your own, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“I thank you for the advice, mistress,” said
Tregenna, who was more interested in this
grave woman with the quiet manners, low
voice, and tranquil air of authority, the more he
saw of her. “But ’tis my business to carry
my life in my hand; and truly the vicinity of
a woman as quick of eye and ready of hand
as yourself is as safe a one as I could wish.”</p>

<p>But Ann Price shook her head. “I might
not always be so fortunate,” said she. “Besides,
I must be stirring myself. I have another
two miles to trudge to get to my mother’s home.”</p>

<p>“If my escort would be any protection to
you, which, perhaps, you would deny, me-thinks
’twould be less hazardous than a walk
across a wild road alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span></p>

<p>Dark as it was; for the light given by the
moon was as yet but faint, and the inn’s oil-lamp
scarcely threw its light so far as the
place where they stood, Tregenna fancied he
saw a smile on her face. She answered quite
gravely, however—</p>

<p>“I shall not walk, I thank you, sir. I have
a load of hay to take home; and yonder, as I
think, comes the cart with it. I’ll bid you a
good-night, sir.”</p>

<p>She was looking up the road, and listening,
Tregenna heard the creaking of wheels; but
he did not take her hint to retreat; he followed
her, as she went to meet the cart, which was
at that moment descending into the main street
by a narrow lane behind the cottages on the
right. He was suspicious of that cart with
its load of hay.</p>

<p>There was a great difficulty in getting the
heavy wheels out of the mire of the lane; and
Ann hurried to the assistance of the young
boy who was leading the horse. At the same
moment, the brigadier, cursing loud and deep,
came at a smart pace down the hill from the
Parsonage.</p>

<p>“They’ve tricked us! They’re a set of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
rascally thieves!” yelled he, as soon as he
caught sight of Tregenna. “Your parson and
his daughter are in league with the smugglers,
damn them!”</p>

<p>“Why, what—what mean you, general?”</p>

<p>“We’ve searched the house, from garret to
cellar; and devil a ghost of a smuggler is there
in the place.”</p>

<p>Tregenna glanced quickly from the brigadier
to the hay-cart, which was just clear of the
lane. As he did so, he was on the point of
suggesting to the brigadier that he and his
soldiers should follow that vehicle, when he
was stopped by seeing Ann Price raise her
arm, while, at the same moment, she hailed
him in a clear voice—</p>

<p>“Sir, one moment! Will you come hither,
sir?”</p>

<p>It was plainly Tregenna whom she addressed.
It is doubtful whether the brigadier
even recognized his charmer of the daylight
hours, for the frown did not lift from his brows,
neither did he salute her in any way.</p>

<p>Tregenna, with a word to his companion,
returned quickly to the woman’s side.</p>

<p>“Maybe, sir,” said she, in the same low,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
level voice as before, “you would not mind if
I use my sex’s privilege, and beg you’ll be so
good as come with me as far as the ford. The
roads be monstrous bad, and I’ve but this little
lad with me, to help me at a pinch to get the
cart along.”</p>

<p>Tregenna assented at once; though by no
means so confiding or so self-confident as the
brigadier, and well aware that there was something
rather uncanny, rather mysterious, about
this woman who could fell a man like an ox
while addressing him with lamb-like gentleness;
he was too young, too full-blooded, not
to relish the adventure, and was quite ready to
face the danger into which she might lead him.</p>

<p>His first idea had been that the cartful of
hay was merely a receptacle for contraband
goods, and it had been his intention to make
this suggestion to the brigadier. But this
request on the part of the woman that he
should accompany her on her drive, necessarily
put that notion out of his head.</p>

<p>He got up beside her, the boy mounted
behind, and they started on their journey,
jogging through the miry, rutty roads at a
snail’s pace, with the lantern swinging on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
off-side of the cart with every motion of the
vehicle.</p>

<p>They went so slowly, and the cart was so
uncomfortable from the lack of springs, that
the journey would have been miserably tedious
but for the interest Tregenna felt in the woman
herself, an interest which increased tenfold as
he listened to her conversation.</p>

<p>She was very frank, very straightforward,
and made no more pretense than she had done
to the brigadier of being shocked by the doings
of the smugglers.</p>

<p>“They’ve been brought up to it like to a
trade,” said she, “and it’s passed from father
to son. And when duties be high, so I’ve
heard say, the free-traders start up from the
ground like to mushrooms. And look, sir, be
they so much to blame as the folks that buy
their goods from them, and that think no
harm of getting goods cheap, seeing that, after
all, defrauding a Government never seems like
the same thing as defrauding a man? Governments
doan’t seem to be flesh and blood
like to ourselves, do they, sir?”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe not. But still——”</p>

<p>“Still, it brings it home to us that ’tis a crime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
to smuggle when the king sends down a troop
of redcoats to shoot us down, sir. Ah, yes, sir,
I’m not defending ’em, though there’s many a
good-hearted lad among them; ay, and some
of my own kin too, I’m main sorry to tell.”</p>

<p>“Surely they’ll not be so foolhardy as to continue
in these ways, now that they must do it
at such fearsome risk!” urged Tregenna.</p>

<p>“Nay, sir, I know not. But ’twould be a fair
day for Sussex if you could but get the men to
give it up, and to take to honester work again.”</p>

<p>The words were hardly out of her mouth
when the cart sank down into a small morass
with such a jerk that Tregenna, less used to this
type of vehicle than his companions, was all
but precipitated into the road. At the same
moment a slight groan from the back part of
the cart struck upon his ears, and startled him
considerably.</p>

<p>All at once it flashed into his mind that it
was not a load of contraband tobacco and spirits,
laces and silks that the hay was concealing, but
the wounded smuggler Tom, who had eluded
the brigadier, escaping by the back way from
the Parsonage on the approach of the soldiers.
Almost at the same moment he realized why it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
was that Ann Price had shown such a sudden
desire for his own company. The artful woman
had guessed his suspicions of herself and her
load of hay, and had invited Tregenna to put
him off the scent, and to avoid having her
vehicle overhauled by the soldiers.</p>

<p>He took care not to betray, by word or sign,
that he had heard that groan from the wounded
man; he went on talking to Ann, getting her
opinions on agricultural topics, which she gave
with characteristic intelligence. And all the
while he was congratulating himself that he
should find out where Tom lived, and be able
to follow him up and bring him to justice.</p>

<p>There was another thing that he wished to
find out: whether the tipsy smuggler whom
Ann Price had treated so cavalierly was the
“Ben Bax” whose knife he had found beside
the murdered coastguardsman. He put the
question to her direct—</p>

<p>“Was that fellow who affronted you in the
street yonder the man they call ‘Ben Bax’?”
he asked at the first convenient opening in
their conversation.</p>

<p>But Ann, whether she knew the reason of
his question or not, was cautious in her answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe,” she answered, as if indifferently,
“there be plenty o’ Baxes in these parts;
they’re in every village. I know not whether
I ever heard yonder fellow called by any other
name than ‘Ben the Blast.’”</p>

<p>“He’s a fisherman, I suppose, by his dress?”
pursued Tregenna.</p>

<p>She gave him a straight look, turning her
head stolidly towards him to do so.</p>

<p>“He’s mate of a merchantman, I think,” said
she. “We don’t see much of him up here,
and we shouldn’t mind if we saw less. He’s a
rough fellow, and free with his fists when he’s
in liquor.”</p>

<p>“It seems you know how to manage him,
however,” said Tregenna.</p>

<p>Ann only smiled. And Tregenna, who saw
that she meant to let him know no more, allowed
the subject to drop.</p>

<p>They had by this time jogged some distance
out of the village, and were descending a slope
towards the river.</p>

<p>“We shall have to cross the water by the
ford,” said she. “You’re not afraid, sir, to do
it in the dark?”</p>

<p>“Not with you,” answered Tregenna,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
promptly. “Have you much further to go,
when the river is crossed?”</p>

<p>“Not above another mile,” replied Ann.
“And if you can’t stay the night at the farm,
sir, we can put you in the way of coming back
by a path, a little higher up, where there’s
a ferry-boat to take you across.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” replied Tregenna. “I wish I
could avail myself of your hospitality, but I
must return to my boat to-night.”</p>

<p>They were descending the hill in the same
jog-trot fashion, and were within a few yards
of the river, which was flowing swiftly, and
looked, Tregenna thought, somewhat perilous
to negotiate, when Ann uttered an exclamation
of dismay.</p>

<p>“Mercy on me!” cried she, in a tone of
great annoyance, “if I haven’t dropped my
whip! And it’ll need all the lashing I can
give her to get the mare across, with the river
running as swift as it does to-night.”</p>

<p>She had reined in the animal, and was peering
round in the road with anxious eyes.</p>

<p>“Did you mind, sir, when I had it last?
Nay, nay, for sure you don’t. You’d have
spoken if you’d seen it drop. Would you hold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
the reins a moment, sir, while I go back up
the hill in search of it?”</p>

<p>“Nay, I’ll do that,” replied Tregenna readily.
“I’ll take the lantern.”</p>

<p>He had unfastened the great clumsy thing
from the side of the vehicle while he spoke,
and had already begun his search. He had
almost reached the crest of the hill before he
found the whip, lying in a pool of mud under
the hedge by the side of the road.</p>

<p>“Hey!” cried he, as he picked it up and
cracked it in the air. “I’ve found it!”</p>

<p>As he turned, with the lantern in one hand,
and the whip in the other, and looked down
the hill towards the cart, he was astonished to
see, by the light of the moon which had grown
stronger since they started, the lad who had
been at the back of the cart leap up to the
seat beside Ann, with a long stick, cut from
the hedge, in his hand.</p>

<p>The next moment, with a speed which, compared
with her former jog-trot, was like that
of an arrow from a bow, the mare was galloping
towards the river, lashed unsparingly by
her driver.</p>

<p>Pursuit was hopeless. Almost before Tregenna<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
had time to recognize that he had been
tricked, the cart, swaying, splashing, dashing
through little eddies of foam, was in the middle
of the stream.</p>

<p>He ran a few paces, stumbling in the ruts
of the road, and muttering uncomplimentary
things of the high-spirited lady and all her sex.
But, long before he reached his side of the
river the cart had gained the other, and was
galloping along the road at a pace which put
all thoughts of overtaking it to flight.</p>

<p>Disgusted, furious, and vowing vengeance
against both Ann and smuggler Tom, Lieutenant
Tregenna dashed the lantern on the ground,
flung the whip into the middle of the stream,
and returned towards the shore as fast as possible,
taking a byway to the cliffs, lest any of
Ann’s friends should see him, and rejoice at
his discomfiture.</p>

<p class="noindent center small">A COLLISION.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">On</span> the following day Tregenna sent word
to General Hambledon that he had better
search the neighborhood of Rede Hall for
“Gardener Tom,” who had escaped him at the
Parsonage on the previous evening.</p>

<p>But he had very little hope of any result;
and his fears were justified when, a few days
later, he met the brigadier, who had, of course,
been as completely fooled by the artful Ann
as Tregenna himself had been.</p>

<p>Ann, whom the general had found with her
arms in the wash-tub, placid, stolid, and as
amiable as ever, had made profuse apologies for
her behavior to Tregenna, whom she professed
herself ashamed to meet. She had had no idea,
she said, that there was any one hidden in the
cart until the lieutenant had got out in search
of the lost whip. Then a man had started up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
from under the hay, put a pistol to her head,
and threatened her with instant death if she
did not drive on, which she was thus forced
to do. After crossing the river, he had jumped
out at the first bend of the road, and she had
no idea what had become of him.</p>

<p>Even the brigadier seemed to have his
doubts about the entire truth of Ann’s story;
but Tregenna, who knew it was a tissue of
falsehoods, said nothing. He perceived already
that General Hambledon’s precious plan of
“getting hold of the women, my boy,” only
had the result of letting the women get hold
of him.</p>

<p>Then there came a lull in the excitement of
the times. Ben the Blast had disappeared
from the neighborhood, without Tregenna’s
having been able to identify him with the
owner of the blood-stained knife. There were
no more raids; there were no more discoveries,
things seemed to have settled down, and it
appeared impossible to suspect the peaceful-looking
carters and plowmen who went stolidly
about their work in the fields, looking as
placid and unenterprising as their own oxen,
of having had any hand in the lawless practises<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
which the soldiers and the cutter’s men had
been sent to quell.</p>

<p>The cutter was generally cruising about,
keeping a sharp lookout on the coast for suspicious-looking
craft, so that Tregenna got
very little time ashore. On the rare occasions
when he did get as far inland as the village of
Hurst, he always felt a longing to call at the
Parsonage and twit Joan with her lawless
behavior in helping a criminal to escape.</p>

<p>He was returning to the shore one day,
after paying a duty visit to Hurst Court, where
the ladies’ sympathy with him had been quite
overwhelming, though he shrewdly guessed
that their silken frocks had been cheaply come
by, when he saw Mistress Joan, with a small
flock of sheep before her, and a long osier
wand in her hand, coming across the high
ground from the marsh.</p>

<p>She instantly checked her pace, as if to
give him an opportunity to pass before she
and her flock came up with him. But he, of
course, checked his speed too, and raised his
hat with a deep bow as soon as she came near.</p>

<p>Joan threw back the heavy folds of her
hooded cloak, and curtsied politely, but with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
a certain stately bashfulness which showed that
his anxiety to meet her had scarcely been
reciprocated.</p>

<p>Tregenna, however, was not to be daunted.
He could not help feeling a strong interest in
the spirited young creature, and his heart had
leapt up at the chance of speaking with her
again.</p>

<p>“Turned shepherdess, I perceive, Mistress
Joan!” said he, leaving the road to meet her
as he spoke.</p>

<p>“And not a very skilful one, I fear,” replied
she, keeping her gaze fixed on the sheep, who
showed a decided inclination to wander. “They
belong to an old dame that lives on the edge
of the marsh yonder; and I offered to bring
them into the village, and to fold them for the
night in our own meadow, that they might go
to market to-morrow morning with those of a
neighbor.”</p>

<p>“May I not assist you in your task? ’Tis no
easy one, I see.”</p>

<p>“And have you no fear, sir, lest they should
be the property of smugglers, or lest the wool
which covers them be the receptacle of contraband
goods, even as innocent hay may be?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
asked she, with a certain demure mischief in
her tone which piqued him.</p>

<p>“Well, madam, since you challenge me,”
retorted Tregenna, “I own I may have reason
for such thoughts; for you have shown a
marked tenderness, if I must say so, towards
the breakers of the law, even to assisting a
criminal to escape, that had a warrant out
against him.”</p>

<p>A change came over Joan’s handsome face.
The look of mutinous mischief in her eyes gave
place to a certain wistful kindliness even more
attractive. And she spoke in such a tender,
pleading, gentle voice that, if Tregenna had
harbored any resentful feelings towards her,
he must have been disarmed.</p>

<p>“Ah, sir,” said she, “it is hard for you to
understand, and I doubt not we must seem
perverse in your eyes. But do but place yourself
in imagination where we stand, and consider
whether your own feelings would not be
the same as ours, did you but live our life, and
have your home among these poor folk as we
have. Remember, sir, we have had our abode
here since I was but an infant. When my
mother died, and my father was left with me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
a babe of but a few months old, on his hands,
all the country-folk for miles round offered to
nurse me, tend me, do what they could to help
the pastor they already loved. I was taken
to a farmhouse where this very Tom, whom
we sheltered from your soldiers, was running
about, a little lad who could scarce speak plain.
He was my companion ere I could walk; he
would carry me in his arms to see the ducks in
the pond, fetch me the early primroses, rock me
to sleep in the cradle which was placed for
warmth by the big farmhouse fireplace. Think
you, sir, those are memories one can ever forget?
Think you I would suffer the man who
was my playmate all those years ago to be
imprisoned, hanged, while I could put out a
hand to save him? No, sir. Poor Tom’s no
villain. And even if he were, I would not give
him up, no, nor the sons and brothers of the
kind-hearted women who tended me in my
childhood!”</p>

<p>And Joan’s proud eyes flashed on him a
look of passionate defiance, of noble enthusiasm,
which for a moment struck him dumb.</p>

<p>“Madam,” he said at last, almost humbly,
“’tis very true we cannot look upon these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
men, nay, nor even upon these deeds, with
the same eyes. I only pray that you will make
allowance for my point of view, as I do for
yours; and that you will suffer that we may
be foes, if we must be foes, after the most
indulgent manner.”</p>

<p>Joan, who had suffered her attention to be
diverted from her troublesome charges during
her harangue, now perceived that they had
wandered some distance away. She therefore
curtsied hastily to the lieutenant, and saying
briefly, but with a merry laugh, “Ay, sir, we
will be the most generous of foes!” she ran
off to gather her flock together again.</p>

<p>Tregenna would have liked to follow and
help her in her task, but he hardly dared, after
the reception he had met with at her hands.
Without being positively unfriendly, she had
been defiant, daring, audacious; she had let
him see that there was a barrier between them
which she, at least, regarded as insurmountable.
And piqued more than ever, conscious that he
admired her more than he had done before,
Tregenna was obliged to turn reluctantly in
the direction of the shore.</p>

<p>October had come, bringing with it a succession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
of misty evenings when the marshes
were covered with a low-lying cloud of whitish
vapor, while a gray haze hung over sea and
shore, making it difficult to keep a proper lookout
for smuggling craft, and for the experienced
and cunning natives in charge of them.</p>

<p>Before Tregenna reached the creek where
his boat was waiting, the sun was going down
red on his right, over the land, while on every
side, but especially on the left, where the
marshes lay, the gray mist was getting thicker,
the outlines of tree and rock, cottage and passing
ship more blurred and faint.</p>

<p>He was but a few hundred yards from the
creek when there came to his ears certain
sounds, deadened and muffled by the fog, which
woke him with a start to the sudden knowledge
that there was a conflict of some sort going
on a little way off, in the direction of the
marshes.</p>

<p>Shouts, oaths, the sharp report of a pistol,
followed by a duller sound like that of blows
or the fall of a heavy body; all these struck
upon his ears as he ran, at the top of his speed,
in the direction whence the noise came.</p>

<p>It was at a point where the cliff dipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
gradually, to rise again in one last frowning
rock over the marshes beyond, that he came
suddenly upon the combatants, and found, as
he had expected, that he was in the midst of a
fray between his own crew on the one hand
and the smugglers on the other.</p>

<p>As he came over the crest of the hill towards
the combatants, and, drawing his sword, shouted
to the smugglers to surrender, hoping they
might think he was supported by an approaching
force behind, there arose out of the mist,
from among the struggling, scuffling mass of
cursing, fighting men, the figure of a lad, stalwart
but supple, clothed in loose fisherman’s
clothes and cap, and surmounted by a pale
face, in which blazed a pair of steely gray
eyes, surrounded by a shoulder-length crop
of raven-black hair.</p>

<p>There was something so wild, so ferocious in
the whole aspect of the lad, young as he was,
that Tregenna watched him even as he ran,
with singular interest.</p>

<p>Springing down the slope at a great pace, he
drew his pistol, and pointed it at the lad, who
was watching him intently with a lowering
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span></p>

<p>“Surrender!” cried the lieutenant, as he
ran.</p>

<p>But, instead of answering, the lad, after waiting,
motionless, for him to come within range,
suddenly leapt out from among the rest of the
struggling men with a bound like an antelope,
knocked up the pistol, and, with a savage cry,
drew out a cutlass, and made a dash for Tregenna’s
throat.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent center small">AN UGLY CUSTOMER.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Luckily</span> for Tregenna, the ground was wet
and slippery with the mist. As the lad flew at
him, therefore, the force with which he knocked
up the pistol in the lieutenant’s hand caused
him to slip on the slimy ground.</p>

<p>In a moment Tregenna had seized him by the
wrist and flung him down.</p>

<p>All this time the lad had not uttered a single
word. The rest of the smugglers never ceased
shouting and swearing as they fought, using
their lungs quite as lustily as they did their
arms and legs, and making a deafening din.
But the pale boy never uttered a sound, even
when he was flung down. He was up again in
a second, attacked Tregenna again, and succeeded
this time in inflicting a slight wound on
his arm. But the lieutenant was ready with
his sword, and, just as the lad aimed a savage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
thrust at his breast, he parried it, and returned
it by a cut across the lad’s head, which brought
the blood flowing in a blinding stream down
the side of his face.</p>

<p>At that moment the hand-to-hand fight
caught the attention of the rest of the combatants,
who were struggling and scuffling in the
tangle of gorse and bramble which choked up
the dell at the bottom of the slope.</p>

<p>And a second figure, as unlike as possible to
the first, rose up out of the <i>mêleé</i>, and came to
help his young comrade. A giant he was, this
loose-limbed, heavy-built sea-dog, with grizzled
hair and coarse, sullen red face, who swore
loud and deep as he came on, and made for
Tregenna with a run, pistol in one hand and
cutlass in the other.</p>

<p>“Hey, Jack! Bill! Up with ye, lads, and let
the cursed hound have as good as he’s given
us! ’Tis the lubber that shot poor Tom!
Up, lads!”</p>

<p>Up started from the gorse bushes a fresh
couple of ruffians, the one a long, lean, lanky
fellow in corduroy breeches and an old rug-coat,
that had rather the air of a highwayman
than of a son of the sea; the other a little,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
pimply-faced rogue in loose jacket and slops,
who carried a pipe in his mouth, and a bludgeon
in one hand.</p>

<p>This latter uttered a savage oath on perceiving
who it was that they were to attack.</p>

<p>“’Tis the chief, the captain. Let’s cut his
throat and carry him out, and hang him to’s
own bowsprit, mates!” cried he, in a hoarse
rasping voice, as he swung his bludgeon round
his head and dashed up the slope after his
comrades.</p>

<p>“Ay, that will we, and serve him well for his
devotion to’s duty,” sang out the burly giant
who led the attack.</p>

<p>“Have at ’un! Slash at ’un, Robin!” piped
out the lean man, in a thin high voice that had
a tone of unspeakable savagery in it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the lad, blinded by the blood
that flowed from the wound in his head, had
staggered aside, out of the way of Tregenna
and his new assailants.</p>

<p>On they all came, quickly, eagerly, thirsting
for revenge on the man who was, they considered,
the leading spirit in the crusade carried
on against their nefarious enterprises. But
Tregenna did not flinch. He had the advantage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
of the ground, and his own men were
within call.</p>

<p>Planting his feet firmly in the soil, and
grasping his sword, to which he chose rather
to trust than to his pistol, he shouted to his
men in the bushes below, and dealt a swashing
blow at the burly giant, whom he guessed
to be the redoubtable “Robin Cursemother,”
of whose exploits he had heard.</p>

<p>Robin parried the blow with his cutlass,
while the small man with the bludgeon, whom
they addressed as Bill, came to his assistance
with a swinging blow, which would have felled
the lieutenant to the earth had he not sprung
aside just in time to avoid the full force of it.</p>

<p>At the same moment the tall, thin man,
whom they called “Jack,” aimed at him a blow,
with the butt-end of the huge horse-pistol he
carried in his belt, which made Tregenna reel.</p>

<p>Luckily for him, his own men had by this
time seen him and recognized his peril. His
arrival had made the numbers on both sides
more equal; and the revenue-men, who had
been getting the worst of it, took heart from
the courageous stand he was making single-handed
against the smugglers, and, racing up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
the slope in the rear of the assailants, diverted
their attack.</p>

<p>There ensued a short, sharp hand-to-hand
conflict, in which the lieutenant found himself
face to face with a fresh opponent in that very
“Ben the Blast” whom he had met in such
strange circumstances in front of the Frigate
at Hurst some days before.</p>

<p>Ben came up with the last batch, panting,
roaring like a bull, his face and hands dyed
with blood, his teeth set hard, and his eyes
blood-shot and aflame.</p>

<p>“The damned lubber that I caught with
Ann! I’ll settle him! Let me but get at
him!” said he, furiously, as he came up.</p>

<p>By this time, however, Tregenna had gathered
his men round him, so that they presented
a strong front to the smugglers, who,
being on lower ground than they, and somewhat
overmatched in skill, if not in strength,
began to give way.</p>

<p>The lieutenant noted this, and presently
gave the signal for a simultaneous rush. Down
they came, driving the cursing smugglers like
sheep before them over the rough, broken
ground of the slope, until Ben the Blast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
stumbled and fell over a stone, spraining his
ankle in the fall.</p>

<p>He got up, turned once upon his foes, with
a last vicious blow of his cutlass, which inflicted
a nasty cut on the forearm of one of
the revenue-men, and yelled out—</p>

<p>“Off, mates, off! Game’s played!”</p>

<p>Then there was a stampede. The smugglers
threw away such weapons as they found cumbersome,
and took to flight with as much vigor
as they had shown in the fight. Making for
the dell at the bottom, Ben the Blast, the lithe,
pimply-faced Bill, and two others who were
evidently seamen, made for their boats, which,
still half-full of the cargo they had been in the
act of landing when they were disturbed by
the revenue-men, was lying snug among the
rocks in charge of a lad.</p>

<p>The tall, thin man in the rug-coat, with
the rest of his companions, went up the
slope in a northeasterly direction, towards
the road.</p>

<p>As they were all far nimbler of foot over the
ground, which they knew well, than were
their opponents, Lieutenant Tregenna stopped
the pursuit of the smugglers when he saw how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
fast they gained ground, and directed his men
to seize such of the contraband goods as were
already landed.</p>

<p>When, however, they reached in their turn
the bottom of the dell, where they expected
to find the booty, they discovered that it had
all been safely removed, under cover of the
mist, and of the excitement of the fight, and
that the boat which had brought it had got
out of sight also.</p>

<p>In the meantime Tregenna had been looking
about him for the lad who had been the
first to attack him, and whom he had himself,
in self-defense, somewhat severely wounded.
He felt something like admiration of the
courage the boy had shown in attacking him
single-handed, and was sincerely anxious to
learn whether the wound he had been forced
to inflict was likely to have lasting consequences.</p>

<p>In answer to the lieutenant’s questions, one
of the men said that he had seen one man stagger
down the slope some minutes before the
conclusion of the struggle, in the direction of
the shore.</p>

<p>“He looked, sir,” said the man, “as if he’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
had enough of it. He didn’t hardly fare to
seem to know whither he was going.”</p>

<p>Tregenna went down towards the shore, trying
to find some track which he might follow;
but the mist and the darkness were creeping
on together, and the traces of the conflict
being on all sides, in trampled, blood-stained
grass and roughened ground, he found nothing
to guide his steps.</p>

<p>But when he got down to the beach he was
more fortunate. He found footmarks and
little red spots on the broken sandstone rocks,
and, following these indications, he came round
a jutting point of frowning cliff, to a cave,
partly hollowed out by the action of the sea,
and partly by human hands, the walls of which
were green with the slime left by the tides.</p>

<p>Half in and half out of the cave, lying on the
shingle and broken rocks, lay the body of the
lad of whom he was in search.</p>

<p>It was with something like tenderness that
Tregenna stooped, and, full of dread that his
own blow had killed him, raised the lad from
the ground, turning him, and looking into his
white and livid face, with the half-dried blood
making disfiguring patches on one side of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span></p>

<p>For the first moment he thought the boy
was dead; but on further examination he
found that the heart was still beating, and at the
same moment the lad, who had been in danger
of suffocation from the fact that he had fallen
face downwards, showed by a movement of the
eyelids, and by a quivering of the muscles of
the mouth, that he was alive, and recovering.</p>

<p>Tregenna cleansed his face as well as he
could from the blood and sand with which it
was disfigured. There was no need to loosen
his clothes, for his shirt was open at the neck,
confined only by a flowing neckerchief, which
now hung wet and bedraggled on his breast.</p>

<p>“What cheer, mate!” cried Tregenna, as he
supported the lad by the shoulders against his
knee, and felt in his own pocket for the flask
he usually carried there, and which was as
much a necessity of his adventurous life as the
pistol at his belt or the sword at his side.</p>

<p>The lad opened his eyes, stared at him for a
moment dully, then with a gleam of returning
consciousness. It was at that moment that
Tregenna put the flask of <i>aqua vitæ</i> to his lips.</p>

<p>“Drink, lad, drink. ’Twill bring thy senses
together. And fear not. We’ll not let a brave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
boy hang, smuggler though he may be!
Drink, and fear not. But take this warning,
not to meddle with the affairs of lawless folk
again.”</p>

<p>Still the boy maintained the dead silence
which had been such a strangely marked
characteristic of him during the fight. He
gulped down the spirit put to his lips, and
then sat, with his head bent upon his hand, as
if still half stupid, either from the blow which
had wounded him or from consequent loss of
blood.</p>

<p>Tregenna thought there was something of
despair in his attitude, and in the wild gaze with
which he looked about him, staring first at the
gray sea, the edge of which was like a roll of
white vapor, and then at the frowning cliff
above him. He seemed to be listening for
some voice, some footstep.</p>

<p>“Come,” said the lieutenant, in a cheery
tone, “don’t lose thy spirit, boy; thou showedst
enough and to spare but an hour since.
Thy comrades are gone, ’tis true, and thou art
left alone. But, give but thy word to refrain
from such company for the future, and I’ll pardon
thee, and see thee on thy way, for the sake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
of the courage thou hast shown, ill as thy cause
was.”</p>

<p>Still the lad said nothing in answer. But he
looked around him with returning intelligence,
not at his captor indeed, but at everything else,
and particularly at the cliffs, with their jutting
points and scrubby growth of reed and flowering
weed.</p>

<p>Tregenna followed the direction of his eyes,
but saw nothing in particular to attract his
attention. But as he took a step away the lad
suddenly sprang up, snatching up the lieutenant’s
pistol, which he had deposited on the
ground while tending the wounded boy, and
made for a point where the cliff was steepest
and apparently most inaccessible.</p>

<p>As soon as he reached it he placed his foot
on a ledge of the rock, and, seizing a rope
which was evidently well-known to him, began
to climb up the face of the cliff with astounding
agility, considering his recent dazed condition.</p>

<p>Tregenna followed quickly. But the lad,
who was by this time a good way up, drew
up the end of the rope after him, and fastened
it into a knot so that it was far out of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
pursuer’s reach. To attempt to climb the cliff
without it was impossible and Tregenna could
only stand and shake his fist at the lad in impotent
rage at the daring with which he had
been again outwitted.</p>

<p>But the lad’s impudence and audacity did
not stop there. The moment he reached the
summit of the cliff, he dislodged a loose mass
of earth and sandstone which was lying loose
in one of the crevices at the edge, and, with a
deft kick, hurled it down upon his generous
enemy below.</p>

<p>Tregenna stepped back hastily, receiving
thus only some fragments of dust and earth
upon his head, instead of the heavy mass which
had been intended for him.</p>

<p>And he swore to himself, as he turned away
and made for his own boat, that he would
never again be so soft-hearted as to spare one
of these ruffians, who, even in early youth,
were dead to every generous human feeling.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">As</span> Tregenna went quickly along the shore,
he was not too well pleased to find that one
of his own men had been a witness, at a little
distance, of his discomfiture at the lad’s
hands.</p>

<p>The man indeed had a grin on his face when
the lieutenant first caught sight of him, which
changed to a look of supreme gravity when he
caught his captain’s eye. He pulled his forelock,
and said the boat was ready.</p>

<p>“I suppose you don’t know who that fellow
is that’s got away over the cliff?” said he,
sharply.</p>

<p>“Oh, ay, sir, I know who he be well
enough,” answered the man, promptly. “He
be Jem Bax, by what I’ve heard tell, I’m pretty
sure.”</p>

<p>“Jem Bax! That bit of a lad!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span></p>

<p>“Ay, sir. And, by what I’ve heard tell, he
be about the worst of the whole lot of ’em,
old or young!”.</p>

<p>This certainly tallied with the experience
Tregenna had had of the young ruffian, so he
swallowed his annoyance as well as he could,
and, turning again to the man, said shortly—</p>

<p>“And it’s the old story, of course? Nobody
knows anything about him, or where he lives,
or anything that could help to put us on his
track?”</p>

<p>The man appeared to glance about him
cautiously, as if afraid that his reply might be
overheard by some unseen person. Then he
answered, in a low voice—</p>

<p>“Well, sir, they do say he’s to be heard of
somewheres about Rede Hall.”</p>

<p>“Rede Hall?” echoed the lieutenant with
interest.</p>

<p>For this was, he knew, the home of the
artful Ann Price, of whose wiles he retained
so vivid a remembrance.</p>

<p>“Ay, sir.”</p>

<p>And then it crossed Tregenna’s mind that
this rascally lad must be some relation of Ann’s,
a younger brother, perhaps; for, looking back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
to his impression of the boy’s pale, set face, he
seemed now to be able to trace a resemblance
between his features and those of Ann, different
as was the expression of the calm, homely
woman from that of the fierce lad.</p>

<p>It was clear, then, that Rede Hall must now
be visited, and that in the first place a warrant
must be obtained for the apprehension of such
of the smugglers as he could identify; for Jem
Bax, Ben the Blast, Robin, nicknamed “Cursemother,”
Bill, nicknamed “Plunder,” and for
one other, whom he could only describe as
“Jack,” as there was, even among the cutter’s
crew, a certain strange reluctance to give him
any further name.</p>

<p>When Tregenna called at Hurst Court to
obtain the warrants, in company with the
brigadier, on the following morning, he found
himself in the midst of a very lively scene.
The squire had given a breakfast to the
members of the hunt, and the guests were
trooping out of the house, and mounting their
horses on the lawn in front.</p>

<p>The scarlet coats of the men gave a pretty
touch of bright color to the scene; and the
presence of ladies, in their silken skirts and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
velvet hoods, added brilliancy to the gathering.
Behind the scattered groups on the grass,
the white house and the red-brown trees on
either side of it formed a picturesque background,
throwing up the gay colors of the
costumes in vivid relief.</p>

<p>One figure, and one only, attracted Tregenna’s
attention the moment he entered the
gates. This was Joan Langney, who, in her
plain Sunday gown of russet tabby, with a full
black hood, looked, he thought, a very queen
of beauty among the more smartly dressed
wives and daughters of the country squires.</p>

<p>He let the brigadier pass on alone up to the
place where Squire Waldron was standing, and,
dismounting from his horse, lingered a moment
to pay his respects to Mistress Joan. He had
always the excuse to himself that she might be
able to afford him some useful information.</p>

<p>“Your servant, Miss Joan. ’Tis not necessary
to ask if you are well this morning.”</p>

<p>“Your servant, Mr. Tregenna. I am quite
well, I thank you,” replied Joan, with a curtsey.</p>

<p>It seemed to him there was in her brown
eyes, as she looked quickly up and down again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
a malicious suggestion that she had heard all
about his unlucky encounter with the smugglers
the day before.</p>

<p>“You will bear me no good will to-day, Miss
Joan, since I come to obtain a warrant against
your friends the free-traders,” said he, perceiving
that her glance wandered at once in
the direction of the brigadier.</p>

<p>“I guessed as much, sir. Indeed, the doings
yesterday put the village in an uproar. They
say you had a brush with some of the boldest
spirits about here?”</p>

<p>“I’ faith, ’tis true, madam. I made acquaintance
with Jem Bax, in particular, and I do e’en
propose that, in return, he shall make acquaintance
with the inside of a jail.”</p>

<p>At his mention of the name, Joan suddenly
smiled, as if with an irresistible impulse to great
amusement. She pursed up her lips again in
a moment, but Tregenna, much nettled, said
dryly—</p>

<p>“Doubtless, Miss Joan, you have some kindness
for that young knave also, though he
played me the scurviest trick I have ever
known.”</p>

<p>And with that he proceeded to give her an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
account of his own compassion upon the lad,
and of Jem’s ungrateful return.</p>

<p>There was some satisfaction, however, in
seeing how Joan took this recital. Her face
clouded as she listened; and when he ended,
there were tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>“’Twas infamous, sir, shameful, to treat you
so, after what you had done,” cried she, with
a heightened color in her cheeks and the
sparkle of indignation in her eyes. “And if
they treat you like that again, I’ll be a turncoat
myself, and do my best to help you against—Jem.”</p>

<p>“You speak,” said Tregenna, with curiosity,
“as if that bit of a lad were the ringleader of
the gang.”</p>

<p>Again Joan shot at him a glance in which
there was some amusement. But she answered
demurely—</p>

<p>“He is old for his years, sir, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Well, Miss Joan, I shall think my experience
of yesterday worth the risk if it but
bring you to our side, the side of law and of
justice.”</p>

<p>By this time he saw that the brigadier had
got the ear of the squire, and that he had turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
to see why his companion had deserted him.
Tregenna, therefore, with a low bow to Joan, re-mounted
and rode across the grass to join him.</p>

<p>Squire Waldron, though by no means in the
best of humors at this interruption to the serious
business of fox-hunting, made out the
warrants as desired by Tregenna and General
Hambledon; but he took care to twit them
with their ill success against the smugglers, and
with their failure to catch “Gardener Tom.”</p>

<p>Tregenna took these reproaches modestly,
but the brigadier blustered, and said that he
was ready to be shot if he did not bring one or
more of the ringleaders among the smugglers
back to Rye with him that afternoon.</p>

<p>“And, gads my life, sir,” he went on with
emphasis which made him purple in the face;
“but I’ll warrant me I’ll have it out with Mistress
Ann, and make her give up this Jem Bax,
if she’s harboring him.”</p>

<p>The squire smiled a little, just as Joan had
done at the mention of Jem’s name. And Tregenna
was confirmed in his belief that the
young ruffian was a relation of Ann’s, and that
she would put every possible obstacle in the
way of his being given up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span></p>

<p>When General Hambledon and Tregenna
came out of the house, where they had been
shut up with the squire during the formal
making out of the warrants, the lieutenant
looked about in vain for Joan. Not only had
she herself disappeared; but Parson Langney,
who had been prominent, with his jolly face
and jolly voice, among the red-coated groups
on the lawn, trotting about on his nag, and as
eager for the sport as anybody there, had taken
his departure also.</p>

<p>Tregenna pondered on this fact, which was
the more strange, since not one other of the
assembled guests was missing. But it was not
until he and the general, and the score of
mounted troopers who accompanied them, had
traversed the village, forded the river, ridden
the two miles to Rede Hall, and come in sight
of that ancient dwelling, that the mystery was
solved.</p>

<p>From the gates of the farmhouse, just as the
soldiers came into view, there issued Parson
Langney on his nag, with his daughter Joan
mounted on a pillion behind him.</p>

<p>The brigadier saw no significance in this;
the parson was doing his rounds, that was all.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
But to Tregenna the incident bore a very different
meaning. He jumped to the conclusion
that Joan had set off with her father to
warn the inhabitants of Rede Hall of the visit
which was in store for them; and, on the instant,
he decided that he and the brigadier
would be as unsuccessful on this occasion as
they had been hitherto.</p>

<p>In the mean time, General Hambledon had
caught sight of a lonely inn a little way off the
road, and directed his way thither, with the
very proper excuse that in these places one
could hear all the gossip and pick up valuable
information.</p>

<p>Tregenna ventured to make two suggestions—the
one was that the sooner they got to the
farmhouse the more likely they were to effect
a capture; the other, that nobody about was
likely to give information to them, since their
uniform betrayed the sort of errand on which
they had come.</p>

<p>Of course he was overruled by the general;
and, a few minutes later, they found themselves
at the bar of the rickety little timber erection,
with its battered sign creaking from a tree on
the opposite side of the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span></p>

<p>“’Tis a vastly pretty view you have from
hence,” remarked the brigadier, in the course of
making himself agreeable to the knot of drovers,
laborers, and nondescript wanderers who
stood within the inn doors, watching the soldiers.</p>

<p>The landlord was the only person bold
enough to answer the smart soldier—</p>

<p>“Ay, sir; ’tis, as you say, a pretty view.”</p>

<p>“What call you that building yonder? Is’t
a gentleman’s seat, or what?”</p>

<p>“Nay, sir, ’tis no gentleman’s seat now;
though methinks I’ve heard ’twas a considerable
place once on a time. ’Tis but a farmhouse
that they call Rede Hall.”</p>

<p>“Rede Hall—eh? And what sort of folk
are they that live there now?”</p>

<p>“’Tis kept by an old farmer, sir, that lives
there with his wife, his son, and his daughter.
They be quiet folks, sir, and I know nowt else
about ’em,” said the landlord, who knew perfectly
well on what business the brigadier had
come, as he remembered hearing of a similar
expedition which had come that way not many
days before.</p>

<p>“Quiet! Ay, but they be main queer folks,”
piped out an old man, who was enjoying his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
tankard of ale at the bar. “The place has had
a mighty odd name these long years past; and
they do say, sir, ’tis haunted. There was a
wicked lord lived there in the orld toime, so
they say, and he killed his wife by flaying her
to death in what was once the chapel, and that
now they call the Gray Barn.”</p>

<p>“Hey, man, them’s but idle tales,” said the
landlord quickly.</p>

<p>“Ah doan’t knaw that, Ah doan’t knaw that,”
chimed in another man, taking up the running
now that the first awe of the grand soldier had
worn off. “Ah’ve heeard the tale, too, and
how they say he can’t rest in’s grave, but
works with his flail in the Gray Barn o’ nights
e’en now. And for sure Ah’ve heeard myself
most fearsome noises, and seen a blue light
a-burning like to none other I ever see afore,
as Ah’ve crossed the bridge below there yonder
o’ nights, when Ah’ve been late home wi’ my
wagon.”</p>

<p>“Ay, and Farmer Price, hisself, he’ve seen—summat.
He’s told as much hisself,” said
another man. “’Tis a place I’d not care to
sleep in while there was a hedge to lie under.”</p>

<p>“Tales; naught but old wives’ tales!” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
the landlord, imperturbably. “The old lady
would never ha’ lived all these years in the
place if so be there was aught to be afeared on
under yon honest roof.”</p>

<p>The general opinion, however, seemed to be
rather with the old man who had first spoken
than with the landlord on this matter. And
Tregenna felt more than ever convinced, as
they came away from the inn and crossed the
stream by the little bridge that led to the farmhouse,
that this was the wasps’ nest to be
smoked out.</p>

<p>It was an ancient and picturesque pile of
building, this Rede Hall, standing on the slope
of a hill, and presenting to the view of the
visitors a long south side of red brick, in the
Tudor style, in a state of indifferent repair,
with a somewhat unkempt growth of ivy and
other creepers hanging about it and almost
choking a small door, of later date than the
building, which was now the state entrance to
the house.</p>

<p>The grass-grown state of the narrow garden-path
which led to this door betrayed the fact
that visits of state to the occupants of Rede
Hall were a great rarity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span></p>

<p>Beyond the main building, on the west side,
was the Gray Barn, easily to be distinguished
both by its color and by the ecclesiastical
character of the blocked-up windows, in some
of which the tracery was still almost perfect.
The roof, however, was now of thatch, well-grown
with moss and grass, lichen and tufts of
wallflower; and the swallows built their nests
under the eaves.</p>

<p>On this side of the house was the farmyard,
surrounded by a high sandstone wall; and the
space between the big barn and the dwelling
was filled up by outbuildings, most of which
were in a ruinous condition.</p>

<p>It was when they rode up to the common
entrance of the farmhouse, which was on the
east side of the house, that the visitors came
to the most interesting and ancient part of the
building. All this portion was built of sandstone,
mellow with age and weather. And a
huge, massive porch, with a small lodge on
one side and a room above, formed a fitting entrance
to what was now the farmhouse kitchen,
but which had been, in old times, the hall of
the mansion.</p>

<p>The door was open; and when the brigadier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
and his young companion had dismounted
from their horses and stood inside the porch,
they had full opportunity to note the details
of one of the most picturesque scenes it was
possible to find, while the great bell clanged,
and an old woman came slowly forward to
receive them.</p>

<p>Anything more peaceful, more homely,
more utterly irreconcilable with the notion of
lawlessness and nefarious deeds than the room
and its occupants presented it was impossible
to imagine.</p>

<p>At one end of the vast apartment, which was
some forty feet long, and broad and lofty in
proportion, a fire was built up on the iron dogs
in the great open fireplace; and an iron pot
hanging from a crane in the chimney, gave
forth a savory smell.</p>

<p>Close by the fire, crouching in the warmest
corner of the oak settle, with her back to the
light, sat a woman who never turned at the
visitors’ approach. On the opposite side of
the hearth, but well in the corner of the room,
another woman, large-boned and gaunt, with
gray hair half-hidden by a large mob-cap, sat
busy with her spinning-wheel. On his knees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
before the fire, with a mongrel dog on each
side of him, was a withered and bent old
man.</p>

<p>These, and the old woman who came to the
door to speak with the strangers, were all the
occupants of the huge apartment.</p>

<p>Some other details Tregenna took in, such
as the extreme cleanliness of the uneven red-tiled
floor, of the long deal table at the north
end of the room, of the yellow-washed, rough
walls. He noted the brown-and-red earthenware
vessels on the tall oak dresser, the hams
and bunches of herbs dangling from dark
beams above.</p>

<p>The next moment he was saluting the old
dame, in answer to her respectful curtsey.</p>

<p>A little, clean, bright-eyed woman she was,
spotless as to cap and apron, and as active
as if the stick she carried were for ornament
rather than use. Recognizing the brigadier
with a smile, she dropped a curtsey to him,
and asked his pleasure.</p>

<p>“Faith, dame, ’tis no pleasure brings us
here, but rather the reverse; since I have
reason to think you played me false t’other
day, and that you know more about those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
rascals the smugglers than you and Mistress
Ann would have me suppose!”</p>

<p>“Smugglers! Nay, sir, I know naught of
them! My good man and I have always kept
ourselves from such folks, and brought up our
childer in the same way. And if you please,
sir, you can search where you like, if that be
your purpose, but you shall find no such villains
here.”</p>

<p>In spite of all he had heard, of all he knew,
Tregenna was almost inclined to believe her;
for what could be more open, more honest,
than this manner of receiving them, with the
door flung wide and this frank invitation to
enter where they would? The brigadier’s
manner, however, was rather short with her.</p>

<p>“Let us hope it may prove as you say,” said
he, as he beckoned his troopers to enter.
“We have a warrant for certain of these
fellows, ma’am, and we intend to search the
place. But first I would speak with your
daughter, Mistress Ann.”</p>

<p>“Ah, sir, you’ll be sorry to see her so bad
as she is; for she’s been nigh out of her wits
with the toothache these two days and nights.
But she’ll speak with you, sir, I doubt not.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
And the old woman led the way the whole
length of the room, and pausing in front of
the settle, cried, in a loud voice, “Ann, dost
hear? ’Tis the soldier-gentleman that was
so polite when he came hither last Friday
se’nnight! Dost mind? Him that was so
civil to thee, for all he came to look for Gardener
Tom, and could not find him.” The old
woman turned again to the brigadier, who was
close behind, and added, with some irritation:
“I know not, sir, why ’tis always to us you
come in your search for these evil-doers!”</p>

<p>“We come, dame, where we’re most like to
find them!” retorted the brigadier dryly, as he
came clanking up the tiled floor, and planted
himself before the suffering Ann. “And now,
mistress, I’d be glad to have an explanation
why you failed to come to Rye to see me, as
you gave me your word, to put me on the
trail of the smugglers.”</p>

<p>Ann, whose face was bound up in a handkerchief,
with a huge flannel bag against the
right cheek, turned to him impatiently.</p>

<p>“Sir, I have been in no fit state for visiting,
as you may judge by the size my face is
swollen. I caught cold last market-day, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
I have not left the house since. Pray, sir,
make your search of the place, if that is your
good pleasure, and leave me alone.”</p>

<p>“As you please, Mistress Ann. And I shall
know what to do next if we fail to find the
men,” replied the brigadier angrily, as he
turned on his spurred heel, and clanked down
the great room again.</p>

<p>Ann turned to Tregenna, who had followed
modestly in the brigadier’s steps. “And pray,
sir, what may you want here? Have you a
warrant too?”</p>

<p>“Nay, Mistress Ann, I would fain have put
some questions to you had you been in better
health to answer them. As it is, I cannot
trouble you now; I will come hither again at
some more convenient season.”</p>

<p>“Nay, sir, there’s no time like the present,”
retorted Ann in a tone of considerable irritation;
“ask what questions you please.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I have heard talk that you have
a barn that’s haunted, and I would be glad to
know whether ’tis by spirits or by men.”</p>

<p>“Sure, the best way to answer that would
be to see for yourself, sir,” retorted Ann
sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span></p>

<p>“Nay, there’s a time for such apparitions,
and that’s not noonday,” said Tregenna.</p>

<p>“Come at what time you please, sir, and satisfy
yourself by ear and eye.”</p>

<p>“You mean that?”</p>

<p>“Faith, sir, I do.”</p>

<p>And she turned her back upon him again,
and crouched once more over the fire, swaying
backwards and forwards, with her hand to her
swollen face.</p>

<p>Tregenna saw that she was in pain, and
made allowance for her irritation. He retreated
to the other end of the long apartment, and
awaited the return of the soldiers, who were
now engaged in making an exhaustive search
of the premises.</p>

<p>Not much to his surprise, they presently
returned to the front of the porch, while the
brigadier re-entered the room, hot, flushed,
and in a very bad temper.</p>

<p>They had hunted in every corner of the
house, of the outbuildings, of the barns, but
not a man was to be found.</p>

<p>They took a very cold leave of the old farmer’s
wife, and of the farmer himself, who came
respectfully to the door to see them off. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
was about seventy years of age, and almost
childish, and he obeyed mechanically his wife’s
instructions to salute the visitors.</p>

<p>When the party had ridden off, before the
eyes of the old couple, and the last of the
troopers’ horses had crossed the bridge over
the stream at the bottom of the hill, Ann
looked across, with a laugh, to the woman at
the spinning-wheel.</p>

<p>“’Twas lucky they were but men, Jack,”
said she, “or they’d have found out long since
that, while thy wheel went round, there was
nothing spun!”</p>

<p>And the woman at the spinning-wheel rose
to a full height of some six feet, took off the
cap and the gray woman’s wig, and disclosed
to view the sallow, thin face and mouse-colored
hair of “Long Jack,” the smuggler.</p>

<h2 id="Ch_IX">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent center small">TRAITRESS OR FRIEND?</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">The</span> October sunshine was bright; there
was a pleasant, bracing breeze coming from the
sea; the brown trees were at their prettiest, as
they shed their showers of dead leaves at the
lightest touch of the wind: yet the brigadier
and Lieutenant Tregenna, as they rode side
by side away from Rede Hall, noted none of
these things: for to them the sky was lowering
and the wind whistled of failure and disappointment.</p>

<p>“Did you search the great barn?” asked
Tregenna, interrupting a string of his companion’s
curses upon things in general and
women in particular.</p>

<p>“Ay, every corner of it, and poked into
every cranny,” answered General Hambledon,
morosely. “There was naught in the whole
place, but a couple of rusty plowshares, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
few sacks full of grain, and some lumber that
we turned inside out in search of contraband
goods. But no, sir, not so much as a keg of
<i>aqua vitæ</i>, or a quid of tobacco was there in
any corner.”</p>

<p>“They’re cunning folk,” said Tregenna,
rather dismally. “I have small faith in Mistress
Ann’s toothache, for one thing.”</p>

<p>“Nay, why should she feign?” said the brigadier,
quickly. “The lass looked vastly ill, to
my thinking. Had she been herself, I warrant
we should have had some sport, at least; for
I’ve found her ready with her tongue, and as
full of jests as she is of tricks.”</p>

<p>“You think now that she’s a confederate of
the smugglers?”</p>

<p>“Damme, it seems like it. Wherever one
asks about these cattle, one hears talk of this
Rede Hall, as if ’twere their headquarters.
The difficulty is to take the beggars unawares.
They must have been prepared this morning.
Odds life!” The general started violently as he
uttered these words, evidently struck by a new
idea. “The parson! He was at the squire’s
this morning, when we went to get the warrant!
It’s as like as not he’s friendly to the gang,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
like all the rest of them in these parts. Mayhap
he guessed our errand, and was away to put
them on their guard before we left the house!
Eh, sir? What do you think about it?”</p>

<p>Tregenna was frowning gloomily. He was
honest; biting his lips, he made confession of
his share in the mystery.</p>

<p>“Ay, truly I fear so, and that I had a hand
in bringing it about,” he admitted, somewhat
shamefacedly. “I had a few words to say to
Mistress Joan, little thinking——”</p>

<p>The general interrupted him, breaking out
into a laugh and an oath at the same time.</p>

<p>“Ay, you lads, there’s no keeping you away
from the petticoats!” he said mockingly. “Had
you but held your tongue, and kept your mind
on your duty instead of blinking into the eyes
of a handsome lass, we might have surprised the
villains, and not have come back with our tails
between our legs, like the fools we look now!”</p>

<p>“Sir,” retorted Tregenna, not angrily, but
still with spirit, “I have but taken a leaf out of
your own book. As you were tricked by Mistress
Ann Price so have I been befooled by Mistress
Joan Langney. So that neither of us can in
fairness reproach the other!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span></p>

<p>For a few moments the brigadier seemed
inclined to resent the view taken of the case
by the younger man. After a little reflection,
however, and the finding of some relief in a
flow of his favorite language, he allowed himself
to laugh shortly.</p>

<p>“Well,” grumbled he at last, “we can at
least ease our minds by going straight to the
parson’s house, and bestowing upon him our
opinion of his conduct, and some advice as to
the future. And thank the Lord he’s lost his
run with the hounds to-day!”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tregenna was not likely to object
to any proposal which promised to bring him
within speaking distance of Mistress Joan; so
they set their horses at a smart trot, and were
back in the village without much loss of time.</p>

<p>When they got to the Parsonage, it was the
master himself who answered their summons,
with, they fancied, a rather guilty look on his
face.</p>

<p>“Can we speak a word with you, sir?” said
the brigadier, in a short, dry tone. “You know
whence we come, as I think.”</p>

<p>“Ay, come in, come in. You are both heartily
welcome,” said the vicar, pushing his wig<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
to one side of his head, as his custom was when
he was troubled or perplexed. “You shall
taste of my daughter’s currant wine, and drink
the health of his Majesty.”</p>

<p>“’Twould be more to the purpose, sir, with
all thanks to you for your hospitality,” replied
the brigadier, “if you would assist his Majesty’s
troops in the execution of their duty, instead
of doing what you can to impede them.”</p>

<p>“How say you, sir? What mean you?”
retorted the parson sturdily, as he turned upon
them, apparently glad to find that things had
so quickly come to a crisis.</p>

<p>He had led his visitors into the little dining-parlor,
which was one-half of the lower part
of what had once been a fine hall. The roof
was low, and the beams were roughly whitewashed
like the rest of the ceiling. A small
window, with latticed panes, was set in the
thickness of the wall on the front side of the
house. Opposite the door was the old wide
hearth, the upper part filled with curiously
carved woodwork, and a comfortable wooden
armchair in the corner on each side. On the
high shelf above were a couple of brass candlesticks,
each containing a tallow candle, in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
time of rushlights quite a luxurious extravagance.
On the oak dining-table in the middle
of the room were the parson’s writing materials,
his bunch of quills, round jar of ink, half a
dozen rough sheets of paper, and a sand-box.
And beside them was his pipe, just laid down.</p>

<p>Two strips of carpet laid on the stone floor;
red window curtains; half a dozen solid oak
chairs with tapestry seats, and a couple of
ancient oak chests, completed the furniture of
the room, which yet had a comfortable and
homely aspect.</p>

<p>“What mean you by saying I impede his
Majesty’s troops in the execution of their
duty?” repeated Parson Langney, standing in
all the pugnacious dignity of the church militant,
with his back to the fire, and his wig more
on one side than ever.</p>

<p>“You was in a mighty hurry, sir, this morning,
to get to Rede Hall before we could reach
it with the warrants we hold for the arrest of
certain plunderers of his Majesty’s revenue,”
blurted out the brigadier, planting one hand on
his hip, and thumping the table with the other
as he spoke.</p>

<p>Parson Langney was no actor; the expression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
which clouded his jolly face betrayed
him.</p>

<p>“Sir, I was at Rede Hall this morning, I
admit,” said he, looking defiantly at the officer.
“But as for what I did there, you have no
right to put such an interpretation as you do
upon my visit.”</p>

<p>“Do you deny, sir, that you mentioned we
were on our way thither?” roared the brigadier.</p>

<p>“I deny, sir, that you have any right to put
such questions to me,” retorted the parson quite
as loudly.</p>

<p>The gentlemen were both much heated; and
it began to look, as they advanced their excited
faces nearer and nearer over the table, till the
tails of their bob-wigs stuck up quivering in
the air, as if from mere words they would ere
long come to blows.</p>

<p>When suddenly there appeared, in the doorway
of the narrow little entrance to the kitchen
which filled the corner beyond the fireplace, a
peacemaker in the shape of handsome Joan.</p>

<p>She had evidently been engaged in some
culinary occupation, for there were traces of
flour still to be seen on her round arms, under
the long black mittens which she had hastily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
pulled on. She had exchanged the smart
tabby gown of the morning for a homelier dress,
over which her long white apron hung. Her
pretty brown hair, without any cap, was rolled
high above her white brow. Her face was pale
and anxious, as she came quickly in and thrust
one hand through her father’s arm.</p>

<p>“Let me answer him, father,” said she in a
low voice.</p>

<p>The general drew himself up. “Well, madam,
and what have you to say?” said he, unconsciously
softening his tone, as no man could
help doing when addressing a creature so fair.</p>

<p>“It was I, sir, who begged my father to
give up his hunting and to come to Rede Hall
with me; and if you have any fault to find with
that action, ’tis I should bear the blame of it.”</p>

<p>“And pray, mistress, what need had you to
go to the farm in such a monstrous hurry?”</p>

<p>“That, sir, frankly I would rather not tell.”</p>

<p>“Ho, ho, ’tis told then! ’Twas without
doubt to put these rascals on their guard, and
to enable them to get away ere we came up!”</p>

<p>Joan made no answer.</p>

<p>“You can’t deny it, madam! Remember,
we have already had proof of your sympathy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
with the ruffians, in that you let Gardener Tom
escape from your house when you knew we
were after him!”</p>

<p>“Sir, there was a higher duty before us then,
than that of aiding in the capture of a criminal.
We would have done the same for you,
had you been staying under our roof, ay, had
you been accused of murder,” said the girl,
with spirit.</p>

<p>“Well said, my lass,” cried her father.</p>

<p>But the brigadier’s chivalry was not proof
against the provocation he was receiving from
this valiant and outspoken young woman. He
gave her one angry look, gulped down the
words he dared not utter to her, and turning
hastily back to the parson, said shortly—</p>

<p>“This, sir, is no affair to discuss with ladies.
’Tis with you I would have my talk out, and
’tis your explanation I wish to hear. The lady
must pardon me, but this is an affair which
touches my honor and my fame as a commander.”</p>

<p>“Go, my dear, go back to your work,” said
her father, patting her hand affectionately, and
giving her a nod of command. “Leave these
gentlemen and me to settle this together.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span></p>

<p>Though with manifest reluctance, Joan
obeyed, withdrawing her arm from her father’s
with one tender glance in his face, and curtseying
low to the visitors, with her eyes on the
ground, ere retiring.</p>

<p>No sooner was she gone back to the kitchen,
than the two combatants began again the old
discussion, never getting much further with it—the
one reproaching, accusing, the other evading,
excusing. But they seemed perhaps a
little calmer since that pleasant irruption of the
sweet sex, even when the gentle presence was
withdrawn.</p>

<p>So that it presently seemed good to Lieutenant
Tregenna to leave them to fight the matter
out together, while he made the balance of
parties even by beating a retreat to that end of
the room where the lady had disappeared.
The kitchen door was ajar, and, while the two
elderly gentlemen were still banging the table
and growing purple in the face, he took the
liberty of peeping through the chink. The
yellow-washed walls looked bright in the sunlight;
the deal table, scrubbed beautifully
white, was quite a picturesque object with the
great red earthenware dish lying upon it. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
jugs on the walls, the metal utensils on the
dresser, made a charming picture. So did the
tabby cat, curled up in one corner; so, above
all, did that particularly neat figure in the gray
homespun frock, with the graceful arms and the
clever hands, and with that delicious profile
above it all.</p>

<p>“I tell you, sir, you are no better than a
traitor to the king if you do not help his officers.”</p>

<p>“I tell you, sir, you don’t know what you are
talking about!”</p>

<p>Thus the gentlemen jangled on; but their
bickering had become an unimportant incident
to Tregenna.</p>

<p>He made rather a nice picture himself in his
smart uniform, with his well-powdered wig surmounting
a handsome, clean-cut face, his gray
hawks’ eyes, now filled with the light of the
young and ardent, his mouth softened by the
suspicion of a smile. He held his sword with
one hand, that its clanking should not startle
her; and his smart three-cornered hat was
cocked jauntily under his arm.</p>

<p>Suddenly she turned; and by this time he
was half inside the kitchen door. Joan uttered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
a little cry; and, as if taking it for an
invitation, Tregenna hopped right in and came
up to her.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said she, “what business have you
with me?”</p>

<p>But she was not angry; she crossed her
hands, one of which held a rolling-pin, demurely
in front of her, and looked down in a
stately fashion, not at all disturbed at being
discovered in the act of making a pudding,
for those were domestic days.</p>

<p>“Much the same business, Miss Joan, that
the brigadier has with your father,” said Tregenna.
“There is no pretense, as you know,
betwixt you and me. We are foes avowed.
I ask you no questions about your visit to the
farm this morning, because I <i>know</i> what took
you thither. Neither will you need to ask why
I am going again to Rede Hall, to inquire into
this mystery concerning the Gray Barn.”</p>

<p>“You are going again?” said Joan, with interest,
in which he thought he detected fear
also.</p>

<p>“Yes. And I make no secret of saying I am
not going to be fooled by the innocent appearance
of the place. I am going again and again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
until I have cleared them all out, like wasps
out of a hole. Mistress Ann Price and her
confederates must find a fresh field for their
practises; I swear they shall not continue to
carry them on in that part of the coast that is
under my vigilance.”</p>

<p>“And you do not fear to tell me this, believing,
as you do, that I am in league with them
myself?”</p>

<p>“’Tis for that reason I tell you, that you may
warn them they must go.”</p>

<p>“Why did you not tell Mistress Ann herself?”
asked Joan, with strange quietness. “If
you think, as you say, she is concerned with
the gang?”</p>

<p>“I will tell her when I meet her next,” said
Tregenna, promptly. “She has challenged
me to go some night and find out for myself
the truth of the tales the folks tell about the
haunted barn. She——”</p>

<p>But Joan interrupted him, with a sudden
look of intense anxiety—</p>

<p>“She challenged you to go at night? To
the great barn?”</p>

<p>“Ay, that she did. And I accepted her invitation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span></p>

<p>“But you will not go! You must not!
’Twould not be safe——”</p>

<p>Joan uttered the words with great earnestness;
but stopped, blushing, when she had
got so far. Tregenna took up her words—</p>

<p>“Not safe! How mean you? Surely my
safety is the last thing you would concern
yourself with. ’Tis for the safety of these
smuggling folk alone that you care.”</p>

<p>Joan looked down, and said nothing. But
it was plain by the heaving of her breast and
by her labored breathing, that she was much
agitated.</p>

<p>“Is it not so, Miss Joan?”</p>

<p>“Nay, Mr. Tregenna, ’tis not so. I would
not have you come to harm. If you pursue
those whom I have reason to hold in more
esteem than you do, I know that ’tis but your
duty you are doing.”</p>

<p>“And ’tis in the performance of my duty
that I must visit Rede Hall again.”</p>

<p>“And I tell you again that you must not.
Without saying aught against the people that
live there, I know there are others that frequent
that neighborhood that would not
scruple to set upon you, perhaps to kill you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
for what you have done to their friends and
confederates. No, Mr. Tregenna, if you go,
go with your men, or with the general, but go
not alone.”</p>

<p>“I thank you for your warning. But ’tis
alone I must go. Surely you do not credit
your friend Mistress Ann with any intention
of luring me into a danger she must know of.”</p>

<p>But to his surprise, Joan’s face clearly betrayed
that she did believe Ann Price capable
of such a proceeding. At least, this was
what he read in her perturbed expression.</p>

<p>“Ann is a strange creature,” said she
dubiously. “She is a most loyal <i>friend</i>,
but——”</p>

<p>The pause which ensued was expressive.</p>

<p>“But a dangerous enemy. Is that what you
would say?”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Joan, curtly.</p>

<p>“Well, I must risk what she can do——”</p>

<p>“Even though you know not how much
that may be?”</p>

<p>“Even then.”</p>

<p>There was another pause.</p>

<p>“When do you purpose going?” asked Joan,
suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, that I may not tell you.”</p>

<p>“You trust me not, sir? You think I would
betray you into the hands of them that would
do you harm?”</p>

<p>“Nay, I do not say that. I do not think
that. But, as you keep your own counsel
where these smugglers are concerned, so do I
think it best to keep mine own.”</p>

<p>Joan bowed her head proudly, as if in assent.
But she was not at her ease; she glanced at
him quickly, and he saw that there were tears
in her dark eyes, whether of mortification, of
sympathy, or of some other feeling, he could
not tell.</p>

<p>As they stood silent, he looking at her, and
she turning towards the ivy-hung window, the
voice of the vicar startled them both, as he
called—</p>

<p>“Joan, where art thou, child?”</p>

<p>“Here, father,” cried she, as, with a rather
startled, shamefaced look at Tregenna, she
ran into the dining-parlor, followed more
slowly by her companion.</p>

<p>Neither of the young people had noticed,
so much interested had they been in their
own conversation, that the voices of the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
gentlemen had gradually sunk to more friendly
tones. But both were glad to see, on re-entering
the room where they had left the
disputants, that the battle of tongues was over,
and that the general was sitting by the fireside
in an attitude indicative of a more friendly
mood.</p>

<p>And Joan was bidden to bring the currant
wine, in which both the brigadier and Tregenna
pledged their host right heartily, whatever
suspicions they might have as to the existence
of a stronger liquor in the cellar.</p>

<p>They all spent a pleasant ten minutes over
the wine and discreet small talk, and then the
visitors took their leave.</p>

<p>As the brigadier shook hands with his host,
Joan found an opportunity to exchange a few
more words with the younger guest.</p>

<p>“Will you not take one last word of warning,
sir, and refrain from visiting Rede Hall
alone?”</p>

<p>“I fear I can give you no such promise,
though I thank you for your kindness.”</p>

<p>“Which, nevertheless, you trust not. Farewell
then, sir; for if you keep to your intention,
I shall never see you again alive.”</p>

<h2 id="Ch_X">CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent center small">THE MYSTERY OF THE GRAY BARN.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">It</span> was not without a chilly feeling down the
marrow that Lieutenant Tregenna heard these
last words, which Joan uttered quickly indeed,
but with the most impressive earnestness, ere
she turned her back upon the departing visitors
and hastily re-entered the house.</p>

<p>Far from causing him to waver in his determination
to get at the bottom of the mystery
of Rede Hall and its occupants, Joan’s words
did but make him more impatient for the
adventure. He was ashamed of himself for
certain doubts which would arise in his mind
as to her good faith in giving him this warning.
He hated the thought of believing her
treacherous; but, at the same time, it was
impossible to deny that her interest in the
people he was pursuing was intensely strong,
so that it was pardonable to doubt whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
her professed solicitude on his account was
genuine.</p>

<p>And yet he hesitated to admit the possibility
of her playing him false. After all, he could
make allowance for her feelings towards these
people, among whom she had spent her childhood,
and from whom she had received kindness
from her earliest years. Was there not
something noble, rather than perverse, in her
honest espousal of their cause, even in her
defiance of law and order in the persons of
himself and the soldiers?</p>

<p>Tregenna, if the truth must be told, thought
quite as much about Joan as he did about the
important affairs in which he was engaged.
He decided to pay his visit to Rede Hall on
the night of the following day. It was from
no foolhardiness that he resolved to venture
alone on this expedition; it was from the
certainty he felt that a sharp lookout would
be kept, and that any attempt to bring a force
against the place would be met by the same
ignominious result as the visit of the morning.</p>

<p>The following evening proved an admirable
one for his purpose. It was dark; it was wet;
it was gloomy. After leaving orders that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
sharp lookout was to be kept for the smugglers,
to whom such a night was as propitious as it
was to his own purpose, Tregenna went ashore,
and started alone and on foot across the cliffs
for Rede Hall.</p>

<p>He had taken care to procure a loose, rough
countryman’s coat, waistcoat, and breeches,
which disguised him very effectually, and which
had the further advantage of enabling him to
conceal a brace of pistols and a cutlass, with
which he thought it prudent to arm himself.
A brown George wig and an enormous three-cornered
hat, in a high state of shabbiness,
completed his attire. And there was nothing
but the springy, elastic walk of youth about
him to betray that he was not some decent
innkeeper or small farmer on a late trudge
along the lanes.</p>

<p>He took a short cut, and was in sight of the
hall in less than an hour.</p>

<p>He had kept a careful watch to see that he
was not observed or followed; and he was quite
sure, when he first saw the faint lights of the
farmhouse through the drizzling rain, that so
far he had passed unsuspected and undetected
by such wayfarers as he had met on the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span></p>

<p>Instead of going straight up to the hall, he
walked along at the bottom of the hill, by the
side of the stream, keeping his eyes upon the
building. And it was with a strange excitement
that he heard, when he had come well
in sight of the gray barn, a dull sound, repeated
at intervals, like the noise of a descending flail.</p>

<p>At the same time he became aware of a
faint and flickering light, which was just visible
through certain slits and gaps in the boarding
with which the original chapel windows of the
barn had been filled up.</p>

<p>There was not a living creature in sight,
though the slight noises made by the animals
in the farmyard came to Tregenna’s ears as he
went slowly and cautiously up the slope towards
the barn.</p>

<p>The wall was high, but easy to climb; he
crossed the straw of the yard quickly and without
noise, while the muffled sounds from inside
the barn grew louder and more distinct. It
was not until he was close under the south wall
of the barn that a hoarse murmur of men’s voices
reached his ears, deadened, muffled, scarcely
audible above the steady sound of blows.</p>

<p>He looked about for some means of getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
up to the level of the slits in the boarding of
the windows, by which the barn now received
ventilation and light. Only a sailor would
have been able to avail himself of such means
as he found. A bit of straggling creeper,
that gave way under the touch of the foot;
part of a wooden drain-pipe rotten and broken;
the crevices between the rough stones: such
were the footholds by which he was able to
scramble up to the old east window; and once
at this level, he climbed by the help of the
stone tracery to the rose heading at the top,
where there was a gap in the boarding large
enough for him to see the interior of the barn
from end to end.</p>

<p>It was a weird sight that met his astonished
eyes. By the flaring light of some half-dozen
smoking torches, which threw a fantastic glare
upon the stone walls, upon the still perfect
arcade at the base, upon fragments of arch and
pillar, corbel and broken groin, a dozen men
were at work upon the building of a boat some
thirty feet long, which lay, like some huge
sprawling creature, on the floor below.</p>

<p>Tregenna watched with fascinated eyes.
He had heard of the secret shipbuilding yards,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
where the smuggling craft were manufactured,
and whence they were drawn down to the sea
on the farm wagons in the darkest hours of
the night; but no suspicion of the gray barn in
connection with such doings had ever entered
his head; and it was clear that even the country
folk had been kept out of the secret.</p>

<p>Clash! clash! upon his ears, in his place of
vantage, came the sound of the driving in of
the iron bolts. He saw the brawny bare arms
of the men go up above their heads, hammer
in hand, to come down with a thud upon the
ship’s groaning sides. He saw the great skeleton
monster shiver under the blows; heard the
hoarse laugh, the muttered oaths, which the
men, cautious even at their toil, exchanged as
they worked. And presently, as he got used
to the din, to the waving, smoking lights, to the
excitement of his strange position, he began
to distinguish the words they uttered, and presently
to discover that he himself was one of
the subjects of their conversation.</p>

<p>“Curse me if I think the boat’ll ever swim,
with all these eyes afore and behind us what
we’ve got now!” cried one voice, which Tregenna
knew that he had heard before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span></p>

<p>It was a difficult matter to recognize faces
and figures so much foreshortened as they
were from the lofty perch he occupied: but he
presently perceived that the speaker was the
little mean-looking man with the pimply face,
who had taken part in the last fray, and who
was known as “Bill Plunder.”</p>

<p>“Ods rabbit it! What matters the eyes?”
sang out the burly giant, Robin Cursemother,
as he dealt a sounding blow on the head of the
bolt he was driving in. “There’s but one pair
to signify, and we mean to close them, don’t
we, lads, so as they shan’t see naught to hurt
no more!”</p>

<p>Then up spoke a third man, who was seated
on a barrel in a corner, with a pipe between his
lips, and holding a torch in one hand. He
limped when he moved, and Tregenna guessed
that this was the “Gardener Tom” whom he
had himself wounded, and whom the parson
and his daughter had sheltered under their
roof. He was a young fellow of not more than
five or six and twenty, well made and handsome,
with an open, honest face and manly
voice: a man too good for a smuggler, Tregenna
decided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span></p>

<p>“Nay, the young officer does but his duty
in running us down. And I don’t want to see
no harm come to him, though ’twas he shot
me through the leg. So we can but keep clear
of him,’tis all I want. Miss Joan ’ud be main
sorry any harm should come to him; and for
her sake I’d have no hand in doing him a hurt.”</p>

<p>“Zoons, then we’ll do without thee, Tom,
when we give the lubber his deserts!” said
Robin. “Though what you should want to
spare him for I know not, since you’re sweet
on Ann; and ’tis ten chances to one she’ll turn
sheep’s eyes upon him if we don’t settle his
business while she’s hot against him, as she is
now.”</p>

<p>“Ay, Tom,” said the mean-looking Bill,
coming close up to him, and sniggering in his
face, “you’ve already got Ben to settle with;
you don’t want no more rivals, my lad. You’d
best let us do her bidding, and carry him off
and let him down the monks’ well, when he
shows his nose up here again!”</p>

<p>“I won’t have no hand in it, mates,” said
Tom, stubbornly. “I don’t mind a fight, man
to man; I like it when my blood’s up. But
to land a man over the head when he’s alone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
and to bind him when he’s dazed and can’t do
naught to defend hisself, why, that’s no work
for a man as is a man, and it ain’t no work for
me.”</p>

<p>“Odso, man, we’ll do as well without thee!”
retorted Robin, wiping the sweat from his
forehead with a huge red hand.</p>

<p>“Ay, and better too!” piped out Bill. “For
there’ll be one less to share the plunder;
and——”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a roar of mocking
laughter from all the men within hearing.</p>

<p>“Ay, that’s Bill Plunder, true to’s name!”
cried one. “Never no blows gets struck but
what he’s thinking whether there’s guineas to
come out of it, or but a matter of shillings!
But there’ll be cursed little to take from a
fellow that’s but a lieutenant!”</p>

<p>“There’s his laced coat, and his sword, and
maybe somat handsome by way of a pistol,”
grumbled Bill, angrily. “Pickings worth having,
any way, and that ’ud not find me too
proud to take ’em.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’ll not have the chance, Bill,
after all,” said Tom. “Maybe the young
officer’ll know better nor to come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span></p>

<p>“Not he!” retorted Bill. “He’s got the
spirit, deuce take him. He’ll walk into the
lion’s mouth, sure as a die. And it’s us that
has to take care he don’t walk out again.”</p>

<p>“No fear o’ that,” said Robin, with an oath.</p>

<p>“What if he should come quiet?” suggested
Tom.</p>

<p>“Sneaking by like them king’s men do when
they’re after us?” cried Bill. “Dost think
Ann won’t keep too good a lookout for him
for that? No. If he comes with the redcoats,
she’ll know long afore they be here, and they’ll
find all taut as they did yesterday morn. And
if he comes alone, he’ll walk in right enough;
but he’ll never walk out no more!”</p>

<p>There was a hoarse laugh at this, which
passed round the circle, as the men repeated
the words the one to the other. And then,
quite suddenly, there fell a silence upon them
all.</p>

<p>Tregenna felt that his heart almost stopped
beating; for he was under the impression, for
the first moment, that he had been discovered.
But the hush had hardly fallen upon the group
below, when a faint tapping was heard upon
one of the great doors of the barn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span></p>

<p>“Ay, ay,” sang out Robin. And turning to
the others, as he rested from his hammering,
he made a gesture to them, with his brawny
arm, to put down their tools. “They’re back,”
said he “back from the shore. Down with
the boat, mates, and let’s see what luck they’ve
had!”</p>

<p>Tregenna was furious on learning, as he did
from these words, that on this very night there
had been a smugglers’ raid carried out in his
absence.</p>

<p>But he had little time for reflection when a
strange thing happened in the great barn below.
The men stood silent all round, each holding
a rope, which he had hastily untied from a
post driven into the ground. At a signal from
Robin, who directed the proceedings, the boat
was slowly lowered until she had sunk below
the level of the floor into the ancient crypt
beneath.</p>

<p>For one moment the torches flashed and
flared, as the men looked down at the unfinished
hull of their boat. Then, just as Tregenna
was wondering why the soldiers had
not taken up the flooring-boards to look beneath
them, he witnessed what he could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
but confess was a very clever contrivance. A
row of boards were placed, side by side, on
high trestles across the boat, at a distance of
some five feet below the chapel floor, which
was then boarded over in the same way. On
raising one of these upper boards, therefore,
a stranger would have seen the false floor
below, with a rough canvas thrown down
upon it, which would have looked, in the imperfect
light of the barn, like the bare ground.</p>

<p>So quickly, so quietly was this carried out,
that it took but a few minutes to transform
the busy workshop into a bare, deserted place,
when the men extinguished their torches and
filed out quietly by the west door into the
darkness and the drizzling rain.</p>

<p>The last of them had gone; the great key
had turned in the rusty lock; and Tregenna
was asking himself by which way it would be
safest to descend, so that he might get away
undetected by any of the smugglers, when he
felt his left ankle gripped by a strong hand.</p>

<h2 id="Ch_XI">CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent center small">IN THE LION’S MOUTH.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">It</span> was impossible for Tregenna to see the
face of the man who had seized him by the
leg; for his own body was thrust through the
hole between the boards which filled up the
great east window.</p>

<p>He kicked out, however, with all his might;
and after a silent struggle of a few moments’
duration, he managed to get rid of his assailant:
and the next minute he heard him drop
with a thud to the ground.</p>

<p>Tregenna saw on the left the smoldering
torch of one of the men who had been at work
inside the barn: he dared not, therefore, get
down and cross the farmyard. Having withdrawn
his shoulders from the hold in which
he had wedged himself, he saw that the roof
of the nearest outhouse was only some four
feet away. He contrived, by a risky spring,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
to reach the thatch; and then it was easy to
cross by the roofs of the outhouses to an
open window of the farmhouse, through which
he peeped.</p>

<p>It was dark outside, with the rain-clouds
and the falling drizzle; it was pitch dark
within, so that he could not even tell whether
the window opened from a room or a passage.
He listened; but at first there was nothing to
be heard but the wind among the tree-tops on
the hill above, and the sound of the tread of
footsteps in the soft straw of the farmyard.</p>

<p>Presently there was a stifled laugh, a murmur
of rough voices, and then the tramp of
horses’ hoofs coming nearer and nearer along
the road. Then there was a low whistle,
which was answered by a voice close to where
he stood under the window.</p>

<p>The men from the barn had gone out to
meet their comrades returning from the raid.</p>

<p>On an instant the place seemed to be alive
with unseen creatures, whispering, laughing,
singing softly. Sheltered from observation
from below, for the present at least, Tregenna
crouched down in the thatch, and wondered
how long he would be safe from his late assailant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
The next moment he saw a head appear
above the eaves of one of the outhouses.</p>

<p>There was only one thing to be done, and
he did it. Springing erect, he clutched at
the sill of the open window, drew himself up
to it, got inside, and closed it fast. Just as
he secured the latch he saw, dimly indeed,
but unmistakably, the figure of a rough-looking
countryman on the roof outside. The
closed window, however, baffled the fellow,
for he went on crawling about over the thatch
without any suspicion of the way by which his
prey had escaped him.</p>

<p>Tregenna fancied, as he watched from behind
the security of the latticed window, that he
recognized in the fellow a rough-looking lad
whom he had seen at work in the Parsonage
garden.</p>

<p>The question now was, having got safely
into the house, to get safely out again.</p>

<p>He groped about him, found the opposite
wall at a distance of some five or six feet, and
soon discovered that he was in a corridor,
running along the back wall of the house. Following
it, he came to a corner, where the corridor,
now cutting through the house to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
front, with rooms on each side, led to a wide
staircase with a handsome carved oak railing.</p>

<p>Here, however, he came to a standstill, not
daring to go down. For the hall below led
straight into the farmhouse kitchen, and there
was no door.</p>

<p>Tregenna caught sight of a couple of men
who were busy rolling spirit-kegs into a corner
of the great room; and he was prone on the
floor on the instant, watching and listening.
But though he heard plenty of noise, the entrance
of the smugglers fresh from the raid,
the greetings of their comrades from the Gray
Barn, the rolling of barrels across the rough
tiled floor, he saw no more. The outer door
was out of his sight, and so was the fireplace;
and it was between door and fireplace that the
movement of the company lay.</p>

<p>When he became sure of this fact, he stole
softly down the staircase, which was entirely
unlighted, and concealed himself behind the
bend in the massive oak railing at the bottom.
By this time the noise of tongues, of tramping
feet, of the bringing in of heavy wares, had
become so loud that he was not afraid of his
footsteps on the bare boards being heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span></p>

<p>As he stepped down upon the stone flags of
the hall, the wavering light from the flaring
torches in the kitchen fell upon what was now
the front-door of the house; he took a step towards
it, thinking that he might escape by this
way. But it was fastened by a heavy padlock,
so that egress in this direction was impossible.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done but to remain
in concealment, and to hope for a chance of
escape when the occupants of the house should
have dispersed and gone to rest.</p>

<p>For the present he was safe; and although
he dared not advance far enough to see what
was going on, his ears kept him pretty well informed
of the course affairs were taking.</p>

<p>In the first place, he recognized among the
newcomers three voices: those of Ben the
Blast, of Long Jack, and of Ann Price, who, as
he judged by the words she uttered and those
addressed to her, must have been herself with
the raiders that night. They were jubilant
over the skill with which they had evaded the
king’s men, who, it seemed, had not had a
chance of coming up with them.</p>

<p>“’Twas all owing to the luck of the capt’n’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
being away!” said Ann’s voice, in a decisive
tone. “That fellow’s the hardest nut we have
to crack. The soldiers don’t count!” she
added contemptuously.</p>

<p>“Ay, but the question is, where was the
capt’n, damn ’un!” retorted Ben the Blast,
ferociously. “If so be you say you invited
him hither, maybe he’s on’s way now, and
that’s how we missed ’un. Hey, Robin, have
you seen any strangers about?”</p>

<p>Robin answered first with a characteristic
curse.</p>

<p>“If so be as I had seen him,” said he savagely,
“there’d be naught for to trouble your
head about him no more!”</p>

<p>“Maybe, he’s gone up to the Parsonage!”
suggested Tom, who had entered the kitchen
from the porch during Ben’s speech. “Folk’s
say he allus has an eye to the Parsonage when
he goes by, spying to see if Mistress Joan’s
about.”</p>

<p>“He’ll get no good by doing that!” cried
Ann, sharply. “Miss Joan’ll never tell aught
to harm us, for my mother’s sake; ’twas she
came herself to tell us, t’other day, that the
red-coats were on their way hither.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span></p>

<p>“Ay,” said Tom, “but ’tis not for information
’gainst us the lieutenant hangs about the Parsonage.
’Tis for Miss Joan’s bright eyes, I’m
thinking.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” said Ann, contemptuously.</p>

<p>“She’s a handsome, winsome lady,” went on
Tom, “and all the gentlemen be raving mad
about her shape and her fine eyes. So ’tis no
such wonder if he’s struck, too.”</p>

<p>“Miss Joan’s well enough,” returned Ann,
though in a rather grudging tone; “but I
think the lieutenant’s got something better to
do than run after a lass just now. Leastways,
if he hasn’t, we can find him something!” she
added with acerbity.</p>

<p>“Ho, ho, ho! That can we!” roared Ben
the Blast, laughing lustily.</p>

<p>In the midst of his mirth, in which the other
men joined, there was an interruption. Some
one ran in panting, and apparently in sufficient
disorder to warrant a feeling of alarm among
the rest.</p>

<p>“Well, how now, Bill? What has frighted
thee?” said Robin Cursemother; and his
companions added their questions to the
panting newcomer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span></p>

<p>At last, when there was a pause, he blurted
out—</p>

<p>“There’s spies about, mates; there’s eyes
been a-watching us while we was at our work
in the barn to-night!” Instantly there was a
confusion of tongues, so great that for a few
moments he was allowed to get breath, while his
companions pressed round him, with oaths and
abrupt questionings. When he was able to go
on, he said, “’Twas a lad from the village yonder
as told me, young Will Bramley, that lives down
by the mash’es, and works up at Parsonage.”</p>

<p>“Well!”</p>

<p>“Well, Oi caught ’un as he were a getting
off the roof of the little shippen, and he got
away, runnin’ as hard as he could towards the
village yonder. But Oi come oop with him,
and Oi says, says Oi, ‘What be tha doing of?’
says Oi. ‘Tha’ve been spying,’ says Oi.
Then says he: ‘’Tain’t Oi as have been spying,
Bill Plunder,’ says he. And he told as
how ’twere Miss Joan Langney as had sent him
for to see if there was spies about the barn,
and as how he’d caught hold of a man’s leg
that was a looking through the slit in the big
barn winder to-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span></p>

<p>As Bill Plunder uttered these words, a storm
of curses and oaths burst from the listening
smugglers. There was a movement, a stamping
of feet, a rattling of weapons. And Tregenna,
brave man though he was, felt the blood run
cold in his veins, as he thought of the fate
which would be his if he should fall into their
hands that night.</p>

<p>“’Twas the lieutenant, for sure! Curses on
him!” cried Ben the Blast, bringing his heavy
heel down sharply on the tiled floor as he
spoke. “And whither did he go? Answer
that! Whither, I say, whither?”</p>

<p>“That the lad didn’t know no more’n you
do. He said as how he caught hold of the leg
of the fellow that was spying, and as how he
was flung off and down to the ground. And
as how he looked and looked, and searched
and hunted, but couldn’t get not so much as a
sight of him no more. And as how he dursn’t
call to any of us, for fear as he should be caught
for a spy hisself. That’s the lad’s tale, and Oi
believe it’s the truth, for ’od’s fish, Oi made him
tremble in’s shoes.”</p>

<p>“Why didst not bring him hither?” asked
Robin, shortly. “We’d have knocked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
truth out of’s maw, I’ll warrant! Which way
did he go, blockhead?”</p>

<p>“’Tis no matter for the boy!” cried Ben, in
a voice of thunder. “’Tis for the man we
must be looking! Do you, mates, search the
yard and the shippens, while Ann and me’ll
do the bit of road, and the bushes in front
yonder!”</p>

<p>“He’ll be gotten clear away by this,” grumbled
Gardener Tom.</p>

<p>“Not he. ’Tis for spying he’s come, and
he’d not go back so soon, and with all of us
about, too. Nay, he’ll be on the premises still,
somewheres, and, odds my life, we’ll make
short work of him when we find him. We’ll
tie him on the brown mare, and whip him till
he swoons, and then we’ll put his body down
the Monks’ Well that lies t’other side of the
hill yonder.”</p>

<p>Then the shrill, thin whining voice of Long
Jack broke in upon the thunder of the others.
Almost sobbing, and speaking in accents of
real terror, he said, thickly, and with uncertain
intonation—</p>

<p>“How now, mates, how now? Best leave
well alone. Besht leave well alone, Oi say, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
may Heaven Almoighty pardon us what we’ve
done this noight! It’s ill work is murder, and
it’ll be murder if you come against him this
noight.”</p>

<p>Ben the Blast gave a contemptuous grunt.
“Ugh!” cried he, surlily; “drop that sniveling,
Jack! Thou are loike to a wolf with a knife
in thy hand and thy blood up: but no sooner
art thou cold again, than thy tears flow as fast
as thy liquor. Get thee to bed, mate, so thou
doesn’t loike the sound of our singing, nor of
the tune we shall sing to.”</p>

<p>But Long Jack, still sighing and moaning,
got up and staggered down the room. Tregenna,
with his heart in his mouth, saw him
lurch towards the hall where he was in hiding.
But Long Jack, who was unsteady on his legs,
had but taken a few steps out of his right
course, Bill Plunder ran after him, and fetched
him back; and the tall, lean, miserable-looking
rascal and his small ferret-faced companion
went again out of sight together.</p>

<p>They all trooped out quickly, leaving, as
Tregenna knew by the lull, only Ben the
Blast and Ann in the kitchen. They had
taken some of the torches with them, too; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
the light had become very dim, even on the
whitewashed lower walls; while the great
timbered roof overhead was now in pitchy
blackness.</p>

<p>There was a silence when Ben and Ann
were alone together, after he had gone to the
door and slammed it. Then she began to hum
softly to herself.</p>

<p>“What art a-singing for?” asked Ben,
gruffly.</p>

<p>“To keep up my spirits maybe,” returned
she, saucily.</p>

<p>“Thou didst not need for to keep up thy
spirits till latterly; they was allus up,” said
Ben. “What’s come to thee these last days?
Is’t since what happened t’other day that
thou’rt so down in the mouth? Is’t that thou
wouldst like to be even with them that’s done
thee so ill a turn—eh, lass?”</p>

<p>“Ay, that would I,” answered Ann, savagely.
“I do thirst to pay back as good as I’ve been
given. I’m none of your soft ones, as you know,
Ben.”</p>

<p>“Odso, Oi don’t know it? It’s why Oi loike
thee, Ann. Give me a lass, says Oi, as can deal
you a blow with her fist if she’s a mind, loike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
as you did t’other day, when Oi did but ask for
a smack of the lips. The day yon cursed lieutenant
tried to come atween us, you mind,
Ann?”</p>

<p>“Ay, I remember,” said Ann, who, with native
intelligence, spoke much better than did
any of her companions, and, indeed, nearly as
well as the country gentlefolk. “I played the
poor lad a neat trick, and left him to get back
through the mud of the lanes as best he
could.”</p>

<p>“Serve him roight, too!” retorted Ben,
roughly. “Oi should be main sorry to think
you had any sneaking loiking for a king’s man,
Ann; a lass of spirit loike you!”</p>

<p>“I’ve no liking for anybody,” said Ann, impatiently;
“but my own kin and my own kind.
Liking, indeed! What dost take me for, to
speak as if I’d aught of a feeling of kindness
for the young rascal that’s done more harm to
us in a month than the rest of the king’s men
have in half a year!”</p>

<p>“That’s roight, lass; spoke with spirit.
Spoke loike my cousin, my good cousin, that’s
to be my woife!”</p>

<p>“Time enough for talk of that, Ben, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
we get the coast clear of the cutter’s men and
the red-coats!” said Ann, shortly. “And now,
let’s to our work; ’tis for us to search the road
for this young spark. ’Tis but a matter of form,
though; for he’ll be back to his ship long ere
this!”</p>

<p>“You think so?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure on’t.”</p>

<p>“Still, you’ll have a hunt for him?”</p>

<p>“Ay, and if I find him, I pray Heaven I may
find him alone. I should like to settle accounts
with him—by myself—dearly, dearly!”</p>

<p>She spoke between her clenched teeth.
And Ben laughed.</p>

<p>“Roight, Ann,” said he. “Oi’ll hand him
over if he comes my way. ’Od’s fish; Oi’d
never wish a man worse than to come your
way while you be in that humor!”</p>

<p>“I always have a mind to pay my own scores
myself,” said Ann, viciously. “So do you,
Ben. Take to the right, down towards the
bridge, whilst I search in the bushes in front,
yonder. There’s many a hiding-place there
the fellow might have chosen, if ’tis true that
he’s still on the watch.”</p>

<p>“Oons, Oi’ll not thwart thee. So here’s for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
the bridge. Thou’lt not give me a kiss before
Oi go—eh, lass?”</p>

<p>“Dost think I’m in the mood for kissing?”
retorted Ann, sharply.</p>

<p>And it was abundantly clear that she got rid
of her too obtrusive admirer with the physical
violence he professed to admire so much; for
Tregenna heard a sort of scuffling going on,
and then Ben’s tread and his voice were heard
no more; but the door was opened, letting in a
rush of cold air, and then slammed with great
force.</p>

<p>Ann did not at once follow her admirer to
take up her own allotted share in the search
for the spy. Tregenna heard her somewhat
heavy tread in the great kitchen, as if she were
slowly pacing up and down at the end of the
room near the fireplace.</p>

<p>Should he disclose himself to her, to this
enigmatical woman with the calm manner and
the fierce heart? Or should he wait and watch
the course of events, hoping for a chance of
escape?</p>

<p>As he put this question to himself, he heard a
door open in the corridor above, and saw the
glimmer of a rushlight reflected on the ceiling.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
The old woman who had received him and the
brigadier on their previous visit to the farm had
come out into the corridor and was moving
slowly towards the back of the house. In a few
moments she returned with a much quicker
step, and coming to the head of the staircase,
called, in an anxious whisper—</p>

<p>“Ann!”</p>

<p>From the kitchen, at that moment, there
came the sound of the flinging down of something
heavy, with a noise that echoed in the
old rafters above.</p>

<p>“Ann!” repeated the old woman more
shrilly.</p>

<p>Ann’s voice had a muffled sound, as she
answered, as if she were speaking from a great
distance—</p>

<p>“Hey, mother, is’t you?”</p>

<p>“Ay, lass. There’s summat wrong. I
minded a while ago to have left the passage
window open, with the rain coming in. And
now I find it shut, and marks of a man’s tread
on the floor here!”</p>

<p>Ann’s answer rang out sharp and clear—</p>

<p>“Right, mother. I’ll see to’t! Go you
back to bed!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span></p>

<p>The old woman lingered but for one instant,
turning to the right and to the left the iron
stand which held her rushlight. Naturally the
feeble light showed her very little. The prints
of muddy boots were continued down the
stairs, but she did not care to trace them out,
feeling, probably, that such investigations
might safely be left to the energetic Ann.</p>

<p>With a grunt and a muttered grumble she
retreated into her own room, and Tregenna
heard her draw the bolt on the inner side of
the door.</p>

<p>He heard the click of a pistol which, as he
imagined, the intrepid Ann was trying. But
he felt that the moment for decisive action had
come. He would not be discovered hiding
behind the staircase like a thief.</p>

<p>Coming out of his corner, therefore, he went
into the big kitchen, to present himself to the
redoubtable Ann.</p>

<p>The great hall looked a weird place, with
the flickering of the log-fire and the glimmer
of a dying torch for all illumination. Round
about the wide hearth were piled bales of goods
and kegs of spirits, while the table groaned under
a weight of jugs and tankards, joints of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
beef, and long, flat home-made loaves, generous
preparation for the smugglers’ supper.</p>

<p>In front of the hearth and between the two
wide oak settles there was a gaping chasm,
a hole in the floor of which Tregenna was not
long in guessing the meaning. The heavy
wooden lid, by day artfully concealed by a
piece of rough matting, apparently placed
there for the comfort of the old people who
sat on each side, was now thrown back; and
it was by this lid that the solitary occupant of
the huge apartment was now standing.</p>

<p>Although he was in part prepared for the
discovery, Tregenna gave a slight start on finding
himself face to face with this being.</p>

<p>For he saw before him not Ann Price the
decent farmer’s daughter, with her neat cap
and snow-white apron, her calm face and quiet
manners; but Jem Bax, the young smuggler,
with the rough shock of shoulder-length hair,
the seamen’s breeches, and high boots, the
loose shirt, open jacket, and flowing tie, with
the pale set face, and fierce devil-may-care
expression.</p>

<p>And even now that he knew them to be one
and the same person, he could hardly be surprised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
that he had not guessed the truth
before. For, as there had seemed to be nothing
masculine about Ann in her skirts and cap:
so now in Jem Bax, in coat and breeches, he
could see no trace of the woman.</p>

<p class="noindent center small">SETTLING ACCOUNTS.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">When</span> Tregenna came in, with his wide hat
under his arm, and with the easy air of a casual
caller, it was Ann who appeared more startled
than he did.</p>

<p>She had had one foot on the nearest settle,
and had been engaged in priming one of her
pistols. But on seeing the intruder she started
erect, drew from her belt a second pistol,
which was already charged, and leveled it at
his head.</p>

<p>It missed fire, however, and Tregenna
sauntered up the room towards her, as if such
a trifle as the attempted discharge of a pistol at
him were the greeting he was most accustomed
to.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Mistress Ann,” said he, with
a low bow, when he had come within half a
dozen paces of her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span></p>

<p>She replied by a scowl, and by a muttered
whisper between her teeth of a very unfeminine
kind. Nothing daunted, he still came
on; and knowing perfectly the artful character
of his opponent, and profiting by her momentary
confusion and annoyance at the failure of
her weapon, he seized her by both wrists,
forced her into a seat and placed himself beside
her, still firmly holding both her hands.</p>

<p>“Curse you! What are you going to do to
me?”</p>

<p>“Nothing but keep you quiet for a few
minutes till I get a chance of getting away.”</p>

<p>She laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>“You won’t get away. Not even if you kill
me. We’ve got you fast this time.”</p>

<p>She glared at him, her face within a foot of his,
with eyes full of passionate hate.</p>

<p>“In the mean time <i>I’ve got you fast</i>, for the
moment, and I intend——”</p>

<p>She interrupted him, breathing heavily, and
almost snorting defiance.</p>

<p>“To humble me, to humiliate me, to treat
me as—as——”</p>

<p>It was Tregenna’s turn to interrupt, which
he did with a scorn as steady as her own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span></p>

<p>“As a woman! Troth, no! There’s nothing
less likely, nothing less possible, I assure you.
I intend to treat you—I am treating you—as
Jem Bax the smuggler, as hardened a ruffian
as I’ve ever met, as ferocious as a savage, and
with naught of the other sex about him but the
cunning and the meanness!”</p>

<p>“Meanness!”</p>

<p>She quailed under the word. For the first
time she flinched, and her eyelids quivered.</p>

<p>“Yes. ’Twould be vastly mean in a man to
attempt to harm the enemy who had come to
his succor, had promised to pardon him, to let
him escape. In a woman ’twould be worse
than meanness; but what ’tis accounted by a
creature of your sort, that’s neither honest man
nor true woman, why, in sooth, I know not!”</p>

<p>Again her gray eyes flashed a steely fire as
they met his. There was a sudden touch of
sex in the lowered eyelids, in the flush which
came into her cheek, as she felt the young man’s
gaze full upon her, saw his handsome features
so near her own. She drew a deep, shuddering
breath, and then said, in a fierce whisper,
turning away her head, and moving nervously
under the touch of his strong hands—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span></p>

<p>“I care not to be helped, to be pardoned,
by one who stands to me as a foe! ’Twas the
first time I’d had a check, the first time I’d
been hurt. The others—my comrades—might
look at me askance, I thought, might treat me as
a mere woman, despise me, when once they
found me hurt, wounded, like one of themselves.”</p>

<p>“Still, you need not have let your feminine
spitefulness carry you so far!”</p>

<p>“Feminine spitefulness!” echoed she; and
she made a sudden, vain attempt to wrench her
hands away. “Pshaw, you don’t understand!
And in truth I did you no hurt.”</p>

<p>“’Twas the fault of your feminine arm!” retorted
Tregenna. “The intention was bad;
so, thank Heaven, was your aim!”</p>

<p>She clenched her teeth in rage and agony.
Tregenna was interested, excited, in spite of
himself, by this sudden revelation of the woman
who looked upon herself as a sort of Joan of
Arc, invulnerable, triumphant, bringing good
fortune to her friends and ill luck to her enemies.
He began to understand the movement of impotent
rage which had caused her to behave so
ungenerously. And he saw, too, that she now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
felt ashamed of her act of treachery, that she
writhed beneath his taunts.</p>

<p>“Let me go,” cried she, suddenly. “You—you——
Damn it, you hurt me!”</p>

<p>Unfeminine as the reproach was, Tregenna
was not unaffected by it. Not a very lovely or
lovable side of a woman’s nature was this that
she was revealing to him; but a woman’s it was
for all that.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, after a moment’s pause, “I
will let you go.”</p>

<p>“You’ll trust me?” cried she, quite eagerly.</p>

<p>“No,” retorted he, coolly. “I won’t trust
you. But I can trust to my own limbs to hold
my own in a struggle with you.”</p>

<p>And he released her. She sprang up, drew
back her shirt-sleeves, and looked at the red
marks on her wrists.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry if I hurt you,” said Tregenna.</p>

<p>“So am not I,” retorted Ann. “I’ll show
these marks to my kinsmen, my comrades;
’twill spur their spirits to see I have been so
used.”</p>

<p>“Egad, they need but little spurring! And
in truth you would do better, if you care for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
your kinsmen, to warn them to desist from their
unlawful practises. The king and the Government
are alike resolved to put them down. A
handful of men—and women—be they never
so bold, can scarce hope to hold out long
against such forces as they can bring.”</p>

<p>Ann laughed derisively.</p>

<p>“You know us not,” said she, disdainfully,
“if you think we can be cowed into submission
either by red-coats on the land, or blue-jackets
on the water. ’Tis in our blood to like the
fight as well as the booty. There be spirits
among us—and I own myself one of them—would
care little for the cargo but for the
chance of a pistol-shot about our ears in the
landing of it!”</p>

<p>“But one of these nights you may find the
bullets whizz by a little too near, and see your
lover shot down by your side.”</p>

<p>Ann, who, conscious that Tregenna was
watching her narrowly, had disdainfully withdrawn
to some little distance, and was pacing
up and down, throwing from time to time a
sidelong glance at him, turned, planted her feet
firmly, and put her hands on her hips in a
defiant manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span></p>

<p>“My lover!” said she. “And pray who
may he be?”</p>

<p>“Well, I know not which is the favored
one,” said Tregenna. “But I gather from what
I have heard—overheard, that there are two
who crave your favor: one Gardener Tom, a
handsome lad, too good for his vile trade, and
he they call Ben the Blast, for whom, truly, I
feel no great liking.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, sir, know this: little as your
liking for him may be, ’tis greater than mine.
And as for young Tom, why, in truth I should
be sorry to see him fall, but, ’twould be for his
mother’s sake, and not for my own. As you
said but some minutes since, I am ill-fitted to
deal in such small wares as kisses and caresses!”</p>

<p>“Nay, I said not so, Mistress Ann.”</p>

<p>“You said you looked not upon me as upon
a woman.”</p>

<p>“But there be other men that do so look
upon you.”</p>

<p>Ann came a little nearer, and smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“Ay, there’s your friend the general. He
looked upon me with a most kindly eye. And
there’s young Master Bertram at Hurst Court,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
that craves a kiss whene’er he sees me. You
cannot understand their taste, sir, doubtless?
For you a woman must have soft hands and
black eyes, like Mistress Joan Langney?”</p>

<p>There was something surprising in the sort
of curious scorn with which she put these
questions, as if interested, though somewhat
disdainfully, in his answer. Tregenna, who
was leaning back on the settle, as easily as if
enjoying his rest in an inn, smiled a little.</p>

<p>“Ay, truly I do not know where you would
find a fairer specimen of womanhood than the
vicar’s daughter.”</p>

<p>His face softened as he spoke. Ann came a
few steps nearer to him, watching him with
a slight frown.</p>

<p>“Yet she hath small liking for you. She is
on our side, you know. ’Twas she that warned
us of your coming with the soldiers.”</p>

<p>“She will no longer be on your side when
she hears that you have murdered me, Mistress
Ann.”</p>

<p>“Murdered you?”</p>

<p>“I understood that to be your intention.”</p>

<p>“You take it coolly.”</p>

<p>“’Tis as well to save my heat till ’tis wanted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe you don’t think I shall be as good
as my word?”</p>

<p>“I have no reason to doubt that you can be
as good as your word when you have promised
to do something vile and mischievous!”</p>

<p>Ann snorted with anger.</p>

<p>“Yet you can admire a woman of spirit in
the parson’s daughter!”</p>

<p>“Spirit! Egad, it needs no spirit to call in
half a score of your villainous confederates to
make an end to one man.”</p>

<p>Ann came up and planted herself before
him.</p>

<p>“I wanted no confederates to help me with
you. I did propose that task for myself,” said
she, “in return for the humbling you gave me
t’other day in sight of all my friends.”</p>

<p>“Ay, so you did. But your pistol missed
fire, and I was too quick for you afterwards.”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke his taunting words, he saw
her hand go quickly towards the cutlass she
carried at her side. And he smiled as he sprang
up and changed his place to the other settle,
thus putting the open trap-door to the cellar
below between himself and her.</p>

<p>“Come,” said she, frowning and tossing back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
her short hair like a fury, “you shall not say
but I play you fair. Out with your sword and
fight me again, as you did that day. If you
get the best of it this time I’ll see you safe out
of this, I give you my word.”</p>

<p>Tregenna shook his head.</p>

<p>“I can neither take your word, nor fight you,”
said he, lightly.</p>

<p>“You have fought me before! Did you
find me such a contemptible foe?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed. But—I knew you not then
for a woman.”</p>

<p>“Well, and you own me not for a woman
now!”</p>

<p>“Just too much of a woman for me to fight
with you I will own you to be.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, since you find me too much of
a woman to be fought with, you shall find me
woman enough to give me a kiss.”</p>

<p>“Nay, madam, I would rather be excused
from that mark of your favor also. A kiss may
be given with the lips and a stab with the hand
at the same time.”</p>

<p>“You shall make fast my hands with this
rope, sir, and then maybe you will be satisfied
of my harmlessness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span></p>

<p>“Nay, madam, ’twould take more than a
rope to satisfy me of that!” retorted Tregenna.</p>

<p>Ann laughed; and he was surprised to note
the change which had come over her countenance.
This fierce creature, who but a moment
ago had looked like a fiend with her glittering
eyes and frowning brows, had been
transformed, by a fresh gust of the passions
which were so strong in her, to a being gentle,
mild, humble, and submissive; and all the
more dangerous on that account.</p>

<p>“You are hard to please, sir,” said she, in
a low voice; “harder to please than any man
I have ever met before!”</p>

<p>And she gave him a steady glance of her
glowing eyes which was a fresh revelation as
to her strongly emotional temperament. He
began to understand the hold she got on the
men she met, high and low, her equals and her
superiors, as he noted the transformation from
the bold and daring front of the young buccaneer
to the modest mien and diffident voice of
the more gracious members of her sex.</p>

<p>And he acknowledged to himself that the two
sides to her nature gave her a fascination, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
odd attractiveness, which made her a creature
unique, unapproachable, dangerous.</p>

<p>“I think, Mistress Ann,” said he, “’twould
be better for us if you pleased us less easily.”</p>

<p>She laughed again, showing her beautiful
sound white teeth in a most winning mirthfulness
which seemed to be wholly without guile.
Tregenna, however, was still cautious. The
very fact that she now seemed to him to be
handsome, whereas hitherto he had thought
her features somewhat homely, was enough to
put him on his guard.</p>

<p>“Nay, sir, I am not the foul foe you imagine.
You shall not fare ill at my hands, if ’twere
but for the bold stand you have made against
me!” said she. “You shall pledge me in a
cup of wine; and you shall find it none the
less invigorating that it has never paid
duty!”</p>

<p>The archness with which she spoke was
charming, irresistible. Tregenna watched her
with amusement, interest, admiration, as she
went to the table and poured out a full tankard
from a flagon that stood at one end of the board.
She turned to bring it to him, with a grave,
rough grace that was odd and subtly attractive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
when there came on a sudden a succession of
sharp raps on the door.</p>

<p>Tregenna sprang to his feet, thinking that the
smugglers were at hand.</p>

<p>Ann put the tankard hurriedly down on the
table, and bounding forward to the place where
he stood beside the gaping hole in the floor,
she gave him a sudden push which sent him
headlong into the cellar below, and shut down
the trap-door.</p>

<h2 id="Ch_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent center small">A LATE VISITOR.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Tregenna</span> was so much taken by surprise
by the suddenness of the attack made upon
him by Ann, that he did not realize her intention
until he found himself lying on something
which was luckily not very hard, on the cellar
floor, in complete darkness.</p>

<p>He had not had far to fall; for the bales of
silk which had been flung in from above were
piled high, and made, moreover, a more comfortable
resting-place than kegs of spirits would
have done.</p>

<p>He floundered about in the darkness, with
difficulty finding a footing, and wondered in
what spirit Ann had made him thus a prisoner.
Was it to shield him from the attacks of her
confederates? Or was it to prevent his finding
an opportunity for escape?</p>

<p>This latter explanation seemed to him the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
more probable of the two. The woman was
crafty, passionate, not to be trusted; and she
had seized the first chance which presented
itself for putting him completely in her
power.</p>

<p>In the meantime, while he recovered from
the momentarily stupefying effects of his fall,
he could at first make out nothing of what
was going on in the great kitchen above. A
distant murmur, undoubtedly that of voices did
indeed reach his ears; but it was not until he
had been down there for some minutes that he
heard heavy footsteps on the tiled floor above
him, and was able to distinguish the voice of
Ann, and then of the newcomer, whom, from
his halting gait and from what he could hear of
his voice, he guessed to be Gardener Tom.</p>

<p>Tregenna piled the bales up together, mounted
on them, and having thus brought his head
near the level of the floor, listened intently.</p>

<p>The two speakers had by this time come to
the hearth, and it was possible to distinguish
most of their words. Tom was displeased with
her reception of himself.</p>

<p>“Well, Ann, ’twas no such easy matter for
me to get up the hill to tell thee, and I reckoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
for sure on a word of thanks. ’Tis well to be
prepared when visitors come so late; and, as I
tell thee, he’ll be here in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“’Tis but the parson, maybe, called out to
see some one that’s ill or dying.”</p>

<p>“Ay, maybe ’tis he, for ’tis a horse that may
be his by the look of him. But it may be the
lieutenant, come to see what’s toward; and, in
that case, you’d do well to put those kegs out
of sight, and give warning to the lads to keep
close till he’s gone.”</p>

<p>There was a pause. Ann made no answer.
By the angry tone in which Tom presently
went on speaking, Tregenna guessed that she
had smiled, or made some gesture which aroused
the lover’s suspicions.</p>

<p>“Well, why dost thou not answer me? Art
so sure ’tis not the lieutenant? Hast seen him
thyself? Hast——”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, Tom, are they not all out yonder
looking for him?”</p>

<p>“Ay, and maybe thou knowest where he is
all the toime! Thou canst not always be
trusted, Ann, e’en by thy own friends. And
I’d not trust thee with a pretty fellow like yon
lieutenant. Maybe you got rid of us all that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
you moight have it out with him by yourself.
Eh, lass, eh?”</p>

<p>And Tregenna could tell, by the sound of
moving feet, that Tom was searching round
the room.</p>

<p>Ann, who was standing on the trap-door,
laughed easily.</p>

<p>“Jealous, eh, Tom? ’Tis late in the day,
with me! First ’tis Ben the Blast, and now
a king’s man! Hast no better opinion of thyself,
Tom, than to think thou wouldst be ousted
so easy?”</p>

<p>“Oons, lass, I’ve a better opinion of myself
than I have of thee, for such a thing as constancy!
And for being ousted, as thou calls it,
plague on me if I know I was ever in!”</p>

<p>“Come, now, Tom, han’t I always been
kind to thee?”</p>

<p>“Ay, when you wanted to get summat from
me. Other toimes, I’ve to take thy kindness
turn and turn about with Ben!”</p>

<p>“Fie on you, Tom, fie on you! Get you
gone, and learn better manners than to speak
to a woman so!”</p>

<p>She gave him a push in the direction of the
door; but Tom was firm. Lame as he was, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
managed to escape her, and came back to the
trap-door over the hearth, where a slight noise,
made by Tregenna in his endeavors to keep
his footing on the bales in the dark, had caught
his trained ears.</p>

<p>He stooped quickly, and tried to raise the
door. There was the sound of a scuffle, of a
fall, and then Tom growled out—</p>

<p>“Now, by the Lord, Mistress Innocence,
I’ve got you! You’ve got some one in hiding
below there, and ’tis the lieutenant, I’ll stake
my loife!”</p>

<p>“And what if ’twere?” retorted Ann, coolly.
“Dost think I want a lesson from thee how
to treat folks? Canst not thou trust me to do
the best for us all?”</p>

<p>“Most toimes, yes, Ann. But not where a
handsome man’s in the business. Oh, lass, I
know thee! Thou’rt a monstrous foine lass,
and I love thee. But I wouldn’t trust thee with
a fresh face too near thine, so ’twere as handsome
a one as the lieutenant’s, d—— him!”</p>

<p>“And canst thou not trust me to know how
to shut a man’s mouth, to stop his ears, to bind
his hands?” hissed out Ann, with her lips
close to his ear and her voice low and earnest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span></p>

<p>“Oons, no!” shouted Tom, with redoubled
anger. “Not where thy fancy’s caught, as I
do believe ’tis caught now! I believe thou
wouldst let us all hang for him, while thy fancy
lasted, and kill thyself for spite and grief afterward.
That’s what I think of thee, Ann Price,
and oons! to save thee from that grief, and to
save all our necks, I’m going to tell the rest of
the lads who thy visitor is!”</p>

<p>“You would dare!”</p>

<p>But before the words were well out of her
mouth, Gardener Tom, with a fierce oath, had
flung down a heavy wooden chair to impede
her steps, and swung out of the house at a
gait which, considering his lameness, was a
rapid one.</p>

<p>Ann dashed into the porch after him, but
stopped short with a cry on finding herself face
to face with a tall figure enveloped in a long,
hooded riding-cloak.</p>

<p>“Miss Joan!” cried she, in amazement.</p>

<p>Joan, who was standing at the entrance of
the porch, with her horse’s bridle on her arm,
held out her hand; but she sighed as she did
so, for she knew well the meaning of the attire
Ann was wearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span></p>

<p>“I like not to see you in that dress, Ann,”
said she. “’Tis bad enough for the men to
be at these tricks; but ’tis worse in a woman!”</p>

<p>“You be grown mighty moral, Miss Joan!”</p>

<p>“Let me come in,” said her visitor, shortly.
“I have something to say to you.”</p>

<p>And as she spoke, Joan made fast the horse’s
bridle to an iron staple in the wall of the porch,
and entered the great kitchen.</p>

<p>“You have no one here?” she asked, as she
glanced around the big room, and peered into
the dim corners where the kegs were piled high.</p>

<p>“You see I have no one, Miss Joan,” answered
Ann, in a somewhat constrained tone.
“But you had better hasten, if you would not
meet some of our rough folks; they’ll be in
here ere long.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Joan. And she turned
abruptly to meet Ann’s eyes, with a face full
of anxiety. “They’re outside, searching the
neighborhood on all sides; and I can conjecture
for whom they search.”</p>

<p>Ann looked down on the floor.</p>

<p>“Come, Ann, I can trust you to tell me what
I would fain know,” went on Joan, quickly.
“Lieutenant Tregenna—know you aught of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
him? He said he should come hither, by your
invitation.”</p>

<p>“Ay, and you were so anxious to know what
I should do with him, that you sent a lad,
Will Bramley, to be on the watch against his
coming! Bill, that they call ‘Plunder,’ did
find the lad, and learnt his errand, ere he let
him go back to you.”</p>

<p>“’Tis true. I sent Will to see that he came
to no harm. Even as I would not suffer the
lieutenant to do harm to you or to poor Tom,
for your mother’s sake and for the sake of Tom’s
kindness when I was a child; so would not I
have you do harm to him, since I know him for
a brave man, and one that but does his duty
in pursuing you and your kindred.”</p>

<p>“And ’tis for him you have taken this
journey, by yourself, on a night like this?
Sure, Miss Joan, the lieutenant would feel
flattered did he but know.”</p>

<p>“I would do as much for any man, were it
a matter of life or death, as I do truly think
’tis in this case!” said Joan with spirit.</p>

<p>“Ay, ’twill be death to him if he meets
with Ben, or with Tom, either!” said Ann,
mockingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span></p>

<p>“Tom! Oh, Tom would do him no harm
if he did but know how much I care!” burst
out Joan, with sudden passion.</p>

<p>There was a second’s pause; and then Ann
put her hands to her hips, and laughed long
and loudly—</p>

<p>“Ho—ho! How much you care! You
have confessed, Miss Joan, you have confessed!
To be sure you would not be so
eager if the lieutenant were pockmarked, and
of the age of your father!”</p>

<p>Her tone was so offensive that Joan, who
was accustomed to be treated by her with
deference and respect, was not only hurt but
astonished.</p>

<p>“I understand you not, Ann,” said she at
last, with dignity.</p>

<p>“Nay, Miss Joan, I should have thought
’twas as easy for you to understand me, as ’tis
for me to understand you. This young king’s
man, being a pretty fellow, has taken your
fancy, ’tis easy to see! Oh, blush not, Miss
Joan: ’tis a common complaint you suffer
from. The young ladies at Hurst Court feel,
I warrant me, much as you do yourself on
this matter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span></p>

<p>Joan’s answer was given modestly, but with
some dignity.</p>

<p>“If I blush at your words, Ann, ’tis because
of the tone in which you utter them,” she
said, in a low voice, but so distinctly that
every word reached Tregenna’s ears, as, indeed,
they reached his heart also. “’Tis no
shame to have a liking for a brave man: and
if all the world has the same, there is the less
reason for my concealing it.”</p>

<p>“Well, ’tis a pity your kindness for him
hath brought you so far, alone, and by night,”
said Ann, dryly. “For ’tis a bad road you
have to traverse on your way back, and none
the safer for the rough fellows that are abroad,
and that will be by this scarce sober enough
to tell the parson’s daughter from a farm wench
on her way back from market.”</p>

<p>“I can take care of myself, Ann, I thank
you,” answered Joan, coldly; “so you will
but give me your word that Lieutenant Tregenna
is not here to your knowledge, I’ll return
at once.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause. Tregenna,
who heard the question, waited with interest
for the answer. Ann gave it in solemn tones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span></p>

<p>“He is not here.”</p>

<p>“’Tis well, then. I’ll return.” She took a
step towards the door, and then stopped.
There was a sudden change to wistfulness in
her tone which touched Tregenna to the quick
when he heard her next words, “Ann, should
he be brought hither: should your kinsmen
find him and bring him to you, as I know they
would do, you’ll—you’ll spare him, you’ll do
him no hurt, for my sake, Ann, for the sake
of what I have done for you?”</p>

<p>Again there was a pause. Then Ann
answered, with a mocking laugh—</p>

<p>“Oh, he shall not be treated worse than his
deserts, I’ll warrant you!”</p>

<p>There was a bitterness in her tone which
appalled both her hearers. Joan stepped hurriedly
back into the room, and cried, in a
ringing voice—</p>

<p>“Then, troth, Ann, I will not leave this roof
till your friends have come back!”</p>

<p>“You had better go, Miss Joan,” retorted
Ann, dryly. “My mates, and specially after
a raid, are no companions for a gentlewoman.”</p>

<p>“Nor are they to be trusted in their treatment
of a gentleman. So, faith, Ann, I will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
stay till I learn what has become of Lieutenant
Tregenna.”</p>

<p>The girls’ unseen hearer could contain himself
no longer. He had at first thought that
it would be safer for Joan to return to her
home in ignorance of his presence in the farmhouse.
But on hearing her express this brave
resolution, he felt that there was nothing for
it but to make his presence known to her.
He, therefore, dealt three sounding blows on
the trap-door above his head with one of his
pistols. The weight of the door was so great,
especially as Ann was still standing on it,
that it did not move. But the noise he made
arrested Joan’s attention, and aroused her
suspicion.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” she cried, as she came
nearer to Ann.</p>

<p>The blows were repeated, and then Tregenna’s
voice, muffled but recognizable,
reached her ears:</p>

<p>“Lift up this door, Mistress Ann. Let me
out, or I’ll put a bullet through it.”</p>

<p>And as he spoke, he succeeded in raising the
trap-door a couple of inches, and in thrusting
the muzzle of his pistol through the aperture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span></p>

<p>Ann with a muttered oath, raised the trap-door,
and flung it back upon the settle.</p>

<p>“Out with you, then!” cried she, defiantly,
as she planted herself a foot or so away from
the chasm thus made, and stared down upon
him sullenly. “Out with you, and off with
you! And may the devil catch your heels!”</p>

<p>Thus adjured, Tregenna proceeded to pile
up the bales of silk in order to reach the level
of the kitchen floor. Joan, who was very
white, and who had never uttered a sound
since hearing his voice, came forward to help
him.</p>

<p>As she held out her firm white hand, he
grasped it in his with a warm, strong pressure,
which brought the red blood back to her face.
The next moment they were standing side by
side, and face to face with Ann, whose gray
eyes flashed in diabolical anger as she looked
at them.</p>

<p>Only for a moment. Recovering herself
quickly, so that they might almost have
fancied that the evil expression they had seen
on her features was the effect of fancy only,
she closed the trap-door, and threw herself on
the nearest settle, with a loud burst of laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span></p>

<p>“Well done, well done, both of you!” cried
she, as she clapped her hands in boisterous
applause. “Sure, ’twas as fine a comedy as
ever was played up in London before the
quality, to see Miss Joan’s face when she heard
your voice, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>While she laughed, Joan in her turn was
slowly recovering her self-possession.</p>

<p>“’Tis well, Ann, that it went not so far as to
become tragedy rather than comedy,” she said,
as she glanced hurriedly towards the door.
Then pointing towards it with a hand that was
scarcely steady, she said to Tregenna, “I beg,
sir, you will mount my horse, that is waiting
outside, and make the best of your way back
to your vessel. Nay, fear not to leave me here.
They’ll not harm me, as Ann will tell you.”</p>

<p>“Miss Joan,” replied Tregenna, in a shaking
voice, as he looked into her noble face with
eyes in which his admiration and gratitude
glowed like fire, “I’d not leave you in this
nest of rascaldom if I were to be torn in pieces
for disobeying you.”</p>

<p>“You do not understand. I am safe here:
you are not,” replied she, in a low voice, which
scarcely reached the listening ears of Ann.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span></p>

<p>“It may be so, but I’ll not risk it. I’ll not
leave this house without you.”</p>

<p>“Leave it with me, then,” said Joan, making
up her mind with promptitude. “You shall
mount my horse, and I’ll ride behind.” And
turning quickly to Ann, “Good night,” said
she somewhat coldly.</p>

<p>But she got no answer. Ann was watching
them both with no very friendly eyes. Sitting
on the edge of the great table, and looking
again to the life the dare-devil buccaneer, as
she tossed her short hair, threw back her head,
and swung one foot with great energy, she
waved one hand impatiently, as if to speed the
departure of the lieutenant and Joan, but uttered
no word of farewell.</p>

<p>Then Tregenna tried. Going back a step he
held out his hand.</p>

<p>“Come, Mistress Ann,” said he, “I’ll not
credit that you would have done me a hurt,
here in your own house, however fierce a foe
you might be in a hand-to-hand conflict outside.
Let us part friends here, even if we
meet as antagonists hereafter.”</p>

<p>For answer Ann put down her hands, one
on each side of her, grasping the edge of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
table; and tilted herself backwards, laughing
maliciously in his face.</p>

<p>“My friendship is of no account to you, sir,”
said she, very slowly, in a low, deep, and full
voice, “at present. You shall have it, maybe
later.”</p>

<p>And she turned her head disdainfully in the
direction of Joan, who was by this time in the
doorway, and signified to him by a haughty
bend of the head that he had better follow the
young lady.</p>

<p>Tregenna bowed and accepted the suggestion.</p>

<p>A minute later he was on the back of the
parson’s bay horse, with Joan behind him,
holding on by the belt round his waist.</p>

<h2 id="Ch_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent center small">A PERILOUS RIDE.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Although</span> so much had passed since Joan’s
arrival at the farmhouse, it had all taken place
within the space of a few minutes. She herself,
and Ann and Tregenna, had all been at
too great tension of the nerves to be dilatory
either in speech or action.</p>

<p>When, therefore, Tregenna felt the touch of
Joan’s hands on his belt, he saw, at the same
moment, the figure of Gardener Tom at a very
short distance away, between them and the
bridge. He was going down the hill, presumably
in search of his comrades; but his lameness
prevented his getting along very fast.</p>

<p>Tregenna was about to speak, when Joan
uttered, very low in his ear, a warning “Sh—sh,”
and pointed upwards, in the direction of a
road that went past the farm and over the hill
behind it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span></p>

<p>Understanding without any words that she
thought it prudent to return to Hurst by a
different and less direct way than the road by
which they had come, he turned the horse’s
head at once in the direction she indicated.</p>

<p>They rode for some distance in silence.
The drizzling rain had now almost ceased,
and the moon was showing fitfully behind
ragged, driving clouds. Their way lay at first
along a very bad road, which had the merit of
being open to the fields on either side, so that
they were sure at least that they could not be
attacked without warning. They thus remained
for some time in sight of the farmhouse;
but though Joan watched the building
as well as she could in the feeble and fitful
moonlight, she could make out no sign of any
creature stirring near it, until for a moment,
as they neared the top of the hill, the moon
shone out for an instant brightly on the valley
at their feet.</p>

<p>Then a low cry escaped her lips.</p>

<p>“There is a horse coming out from the farm
stables,” said she, “and going down the hill
towards the bridge. Ay, and there is a second
and a third. But one of the three is mounted;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
and the others are led by the rider of the
first.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tregenna, noticing the alarm
in her tone. “And what think you that portends?”</p>

<p>“Why, ’tis that Ann has saddled them and
is leading them forth, for what purpose, unless
it be to attack us on our way to Hurst, I cannot
imagine. I would now we had kept the
straight, short road, and risked passing the
searchers. Now I fear they may come up
with us, since they will be mounted, and will
lie in wait.”</p>

<p>The suggestion was not a pleasant one.
But Tregenna was at first rather incredulous.</p>

<p>“Surely,” said he, “she would not have let
us go forth unmolested, if she had meant ill by
us! And they would not touch your father’s
daughter, villains though they be. You and
he are both too well known, and too much
respected even by the wrong-doers.”</p>

<p>“Nay, sir, I fear you exaggerate our powers
and our position. These men do truly show
us some respect, in return for my father’s labors
among them. But the least thing will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
turn them from kindness to savagery. And
Ann is in that respect but little better than they,
I fear.”</p>

<p>“She is a most extraordinary woman!”</p>

<p>“You may well say that. The more extraordinary,
the more one knows of her. She
can be as tender as a woman ought to be, as
I have proved many a time, when I have besought
her kindness for the poor and sick in
her neighborhood or in ours. But she can
also be as fierce as the fiercest man, as you,
sir, have, I believe, already proved.”</p>

<p>“Ay, that have I. And truly I think her
fierceness is more to be depended on than her
kindness. She hates me for having, as she
considers, humbled her in the fight t’other day.
And I am much inclined to think she would
never have suffered me to go forth from the
farmhouse alive, had you not most happily
come to my rescue.”</p>

<p>As he uttered these last words, in a tone
which betrayed the depth of his feeling, he
was conscious of a tremor which ran through
Joan’s arms and communicated a thrill to his
own frame.</p>

<p>“You now see, sir,” said she, quickly, “that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
I did well to warn you against accepting her
invitation to Rede Hall!”</p>

<p>“It was more than I deserved that you
should concern yourself with me and my
folly!”</p>

<p>“Nay, sir, if ’twas a folly, I understand that
you felt bound, in the exercise of your duty,
to commit it. But now that you have learnt
so much of their secrets as you have done to-night,
I greatly fear they will make a strong
effort to make your knowledge of no avail. It
was with that fear in my mind I did suggest
we should go by a less direct way than the one
by which we came. You must now, sir, take
that path to the left, and get down to the marsh,
which we must cross on the way to the shore.
Where will your boat be in waiting for you?”</p>

<p>“Down in a little creek near the cliff’s end.
But I will not let you accompany me so far.
I am but endangering your safety. Let me
descend when we reach the foot of this hill.
Trust me, I shall be able to reach the shore
without encountering the ‘free-traders.’ And
for your kindness I can never sufficiently thank
you.”</p>

<p>“If you must thank me, sir, I must do something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
to merit your thanks: I must see you in
safety on your own element,” replied Joan,
lightly.</p>

<p>“What! And then return alone to Hurst?
Nay, indeed, Miss Joan, I’ll not suffer that.”</p>

<p>“Then, sir, you must pass the night under
my father’s roof. He will be pleased to have
you. He was abroad when I left home, visiting
a sick woman. But he will be home again
by this, and will, I am sure, receive you with
a hearty greeting.”</p>

<p>“You are both all goodness, all kindness. I
know not how to thank you!”</p>

<p>His voice trembled, and when he had said
these words there was silence between them.</p>

<p>Prosaic as their conversation had been since
they left the farmhouse, there was an undercurrent
of deep feeling in both their hearts
which lent a vivid interest to their commonplace
words. To Tregenna there was thrilling,
sweetest music in every tone of the voice
of this young girl, who had exposed herself so
undauntedly to danger in the determination to
save him from the results of his own daring.
While to Joan, careful as she was to speak
stiffly and even coldly, there was a secret delight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
in the knowledge of the real peril from
which she had saved her handsome companion.</p>

<p>He was, however, loth to accept her invitation
to stay at the Parsonage, fearing that he
might, by so doing, bring the vengeance of the
smugglers on the heads of both father and
daughter. She made light of this fear; but
finally, at her urgent entreaties, he agreed to
go home with her in the first place, and to
take Parson Langney’s advice as to going further
that night or not.</p>

<p>Hardly had this been settled between the
two young people, when the horse they rode
pricked up his ears, rousing the attention of
his riders.</p>

<p>They had now left the open fields, and were
passing through a wild bit of country where
knots of trees, well-grown hedges, and clumps
of bramble made it difficult for them to see
far in any direction, and formed, moreover,
safe hiding-places where an enemy might lie
in ambush unperceived and unsuspected.</p>

<p>In the distance, before them a little to the
left, lay the marshes, with the white vapor
rolling over them from the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span></p>

<p>Tregenna reined in the horse to reconnoiter.
Trees on the right, a hedge on the left of the
miry road. Not a living creature to be seen.
In the copse, however, there was a rustling
and crackling to be heard, which might be the
result of the night-wind, or might not.</p>

<p>“Let us draw back,” said Joan, in a whisper
“and go straight down to the marsh and up to
Hurst that way!”</p>

<p>Tregenna assented, and was in the very act
of turning the horse, when there was a shout,
a hoarse cry, and a man sprang out from the
copse: the next moment the lieutenant’s bridle
was seized by Ben the Blast, who was no
horseman, and who chose, therefore, to do his
part of the work on foot. At the very moment,
however, that he sprang out from his ambush,
a couple of horsemen appeared, the one behind,
the other in front of Tregenna; while a third,
galloping up the road, joined his comrades,
and, presenting a pistol at the lieutenant,
shouted to his comrades to shoot him down.</p>

<p>The newcomer was Jack Price, whose tears
and maudlin protests at the farmhouse had
excited the derision of his comrades.</p>

<p>“Hold your hands!” shouted Tregenna<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
back. “Do you not see whom I have with
me? There is none here, I am very sure,
would harm Parson Langney’s daughter?”</p>

<p>“Nay,” cried out one of the horsemen, whom,
by the voice, Tregenna knew to be Tom;
“we’ll not harm her. But thou shalt not
shelter thyself behind a woman’s petticoats!”</p>

<p>But before he could finish his speech Tregenna
had deftly disengaged himself from the
clasp of Joan’s arms, and springing to the ground
struck Ben the Blast such a violent blow with
the muzzle of one of his pistols that that burly
ruffian released his hold on the horse’s bridle.
Then, before any one had time to stop him, or
even to realize his intention, Tregenna thrust
the reins into Joan’s hands, and bidding her
“Hold on! Ride on quickly!” gave the horse
a smart cut which sent him galloping forward
clear away from the throng.</p>

<p>Then, springing to the side of the road, he
put his back against a tree, drew his cutlass, and
prepared to make the best defense he could.</p>

<p>Jack Price, with a fearful oath, rode at him,
but missed his aim with the knife he held, and
narrowly escaped being dismounted, as the
horse swerved on nearing the tree. Robin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
Cursemother, who was one of the mounted
ones, took warning by this, and swung himself
off his horse.</p>

<p>In truth, none of them were more efficient
as horsemen than kegs of their own contraband
spirits would have been; and Gardener Tom,
who kept his saddle on account of his lameness,
contented himself with a passive share
in the business, by standing in the road with
his pistol cocked, waiting for a chance of aiming
at Tregenna without risking the maiming
of his own comrades.</p>

<p>Meantime, however, Robin had attacked the
lieutenant fiercely in front, while little mean-faced
Bill Plunder, creeping through the brushwood,
struck at him from behind.</p>

<p>Tregenna, thus attacked by the two, defended
himself with vigor, and had dealt an effective
blow at Bill’s shoulder, when a strange diversion
occurred.</p>

<p>There was the sound of a galloping horse’s
hoofs, of the splashing and churning up of the
mud and water in the road. The next moment
Joan’s horse dashed into the midst of the
group, causing the animal Jack Price rode to
start off at a smart pace; and Joan herself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
alighting in the very midst of the fray, made
straight for Tregenna, heedless of the knives and
pistols with which the smugglers were armed,
and of the vile curses which assailed her ears.</p>

<p>“Go back, go back!” cried he.</p>

<p>“I’ll not go back!” retorted Joan, as she
still came on, and daringly thrust aside the
arm of Jack Price, who had by this time dismounted
in his turn. “I’ll not see you murdered
before my eyes. If they will kill you,
they shall kill me too!”</p>

<p>And she sprang through the group and
reached Tregenna, while the smugglers, for
the moment disconcerted, hung back and
looked at her.</p>

<p>“And you, Tom, I’m amazed to see you
taking part in an attack like this, half a dozen
men against one! Oh, shame on you, shame!”
cried she.</p>

<p>Robin Cursemother recovered from his discomfiture
before the others.</p>

<p>“’Tis easy to talk!” said he, roughly. “We
mean no harm to you, mistress, but we have
accounts to settle with this fellow, and that to-night.
If so be he’s your friend, you should
have taught him better manners than to interfere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
with us. So now, mistress, off with you,
and leave him to us!”</p>

<p>But for answer Joan crept a step nearer to
Tregenna, who touched her arm gently.</p>

<p>“Go, Miss Joan, go,” said he, earnestly. “I
can hold my own with these fellows, believe
me!”</p>

<p>“Curse you! You shall not bear that boast
away with you,” said Robin, fiercely.</p>

<p>And he made a lunge at Tregenna.</p>

<p>Joan uttered a faint cry as she caught sight
of the gleaming knife in the smuggler’s hand,
turned quickly, and flung her arms round
Tregenna’s neck.</p>

<p>“Off with you, away with you! We’ll not
touch you, mistress, but you must leave him
to us!” cried Gardener Tom, reining in his
horse behind the pair, and seizing Joan’s mount
by the bridle.</p>

<p>“Touch him if you dare!” cried Joan,
fiercely, as she turned her head, panting, and
looked full in Tom’s face.</p>

<p>“Why, what call have you to tell us to let
him go, mistress? He’s a stranger, he is, and
naught to you!”</p>

<p>“Oons, mistress, if so be you can make out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
he’s aught to you, we’ll let him go!” roared
Ben the Blast, in his thick, hoarse voice, which
seemed to carry whiffs of sea-fog wherever he
went. “Come, now, what is he to thee?”</p>

<p>For one moment Joan hesitated, while Tregenna
in vain tried to disengage her arms, and
whispered to her to go, to leave him. But she
would pay no heed to his protests. In answer
to Ben, her voice, after a moment’s pause, rang
out clearly—</p>

<p>“You will let him go, you say, if I tell you
what he is to me? Well, then, you must let
him go. For I tell you—he’s—he’s the man I
love!”</p>

<p>For a moment there fell a silence upon the
rough men. There was something in the tones
of the maidenly voice which reached even the
hearts of the smugglers, and awed them for an
instant into quietness. The horses stamped,
splashing up the mud; the wind whistled in
the trees; but the men, for the space of a few
seconds, were still as mice.</p>

<p>Then Tom, the most easily moved, the least
hardened amongst them, leaned down from
his horse, and touched Tregenna, not ungently,
on the shoulder—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span></p>

<p>“Off with you then, master, and get out of
sight and out of hearing before we change our
minds!” said he in a low and somewhat mocking
voice.</p>

<p>Tregenna took the hint. Lifting Joan on to
the saddle of her father’s horse, he swung himself
into it in a twinkling, and digging his heels
into the animal’s flanks, urged him forward
without a moment’s delay, in the direction of
Hurst.</p>

<p>There was an outbreak of oaths and curses,
bloodcurdling to hear. And a pistol was discharged
after them, without, however, doing
any harm.</p>

<p>But luckily for the lieutenant and the lady,
this incident had already bred a quarrel among
the smugglers; and before the fugitives were
out of earshot, they heard the unmistakable
sounds of a conflict which kept the “free-traders”
occupied until Hurst was reached by
the parson’s horse and his riders.</p>

<p>Then, slackening his pace when they entered
the straggling village street, Tregenna, whose
heart was full, turned so that he might catch a
glimpse of the face of his companion. They
had ridden thus far in complete silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span></p>

<p>“What shall I say to you?” whispered he,
in a vibrating voice, as he bent his head to be
near hers.</p>

<p>But the answer came back cold and clear,
with a light laugh that chilled him to the soul:</p>

<p>“What shall you say? You had best say
nothing, sir. I said what I did say but to save
your life!”</p>

<p class="noindent center small">THE SMUGGLERS’ SHIP.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Tregenna</span> must have been harder than stone
if he had not been stirred to the depths of his
being by the courage and devotion shown on
his behalf by the parson’s beautiful daughter.</p>

<p>From the first moment of meeting her, when
he had seen her winsome face and sparkling
eyes in the moonlight, on board his own vessel,
he had been struck with admiration for her
person, her modest, unaffected manners, her
spirit, and her devotion. This feeling had
grown with every meeting. So it was not
wonderful that, on this evening, when she had
braved such perils on his behalf, Joan should
have inspired him with a passion exalted on
the one hand, strong on the other, such as he
had never believed it possible that he could
feel for any woman.</p>

<p>All the greater, therefore, was his mortification,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
his sudden revulsion of feeling to despair,
when she replied to his stammering attempt
at thanks with mocking words, and a chilling
laugh.</p>

<p>It was some minutes before he recovered
himself sufficiently to speak. By that time they
had reached the lane that led from the end of
the village street up to the Parsonage. As
soon as the glimmering light in the ivied
window caught his eye, he said, in a tone
which he tried to make as indifferent as her
own, but in which it was easy to detect traces
of the emotion from which he was suffering—</p>

<p>“You will not suffer me to thank you for
your goodness on my behalf. I trust your
father may be more complaisant.”</p>

<p>“My father, sir, will make as much light of
it as I do,” replied Joan, as she relaxed her
hold on her companion’s belt, and alighted in
the mud of the lane.</p>

<p>Parson Langney’s voice, hearty, cheery, but
not without a touch of anxiety, rang out
pleasantly, at this moment, upon their ears.</p>

<p>“Hey, Miss Madcap, is’t you? By what
Nance told me, I had begun to fear your wild
expedition had turned out ill!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span></p>

<p>“Nay, father, it has turned out very well!”
cried she; “for I have carried off Mr. Tregenna
from those that would have harmed
him, and have thereby made him vastly civil!”</p>

<p>“Nay, sir, Miss Joan will not suffer my
civility or my gratitude. She, who is so proud
herself, will not allow me to acquit my own
debt to her even by a word of thanks.”</p>

<p>“Tut-tut, there is no need!” said the parson.</p>

<p>“And the less, sir,” put in Joan, quickly,
“since I own I had some hand in bringing
about your discomfiture before, at the hands
of the—h’m—‘free-traders.’ Father,” she went
on quickly, turning to the vicar, “I’ll never
do aught for Ann or her friends again! ’Twas
she put them on our track; and they had a
mind to murder Mr. Tregenna, I verily believe!”</p>

<p>She was speaking very quickly, with a certain
frivolous air which was new in her, and less
becoming than her usual straightforward simplicity.
Tregenna, who was too inexperienced
in the ways of women to understand the cause
of this change in her, was hurt and grieved by
it. He could not understand how strong her
anxiety must be to try to efface from his mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
the remembrance of her action in so boldly
declaring to the smugglers that it was for love
she protected him.</p>

<p>Chagrined on the one hand, yet still shaken
to the very depths by the adoration he felt for
the beautiful girl whose touch he seemed still
to feel on his breast, Tregenna stammered out
again some hesitating words of thanks, as he
held out his hand to Parson Langney, with a
shy sidelong glance at his daughter.</p>

<p>“I must hasten back to my ship,” said he.
“And in the morning I shall hope to pay my
respects to you, and to induce Miss Joan to
give me a better hearing than she will grant
to-night.”</p>

<p>At these words, Joan, who had been moving
restlessly from the horse to her father and back
again, apparently unable to keep still one
moment now that the tension of the evening’s
events was over, became suddenly as motionless
as a statue. Then, in a voice which was
as earnest as a moment before it had been
affectedly gay, she said quickly—</p>

<p>“Father, bid Mr. Tregenna stay here till the
morning. These fellows may still be on the
watch for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span></p>

<p>“Sh-sh!” said her father, raising his hand to
enforce silence.</p>

<p>In the pause which followed, both Joan and
Tregenna were aware of a loud, rumbling noise
in the village street below, coming gradually
nearer. And in a few minutes, during which
they all stood silent and wondering, without
exchanging a word, they perceived a huge
black mass, dim, shadowy, like some mammoth
beast whose bulk makes rapid motion impossible,
creeping slowly by in the obscurity of the
trees at the bottom of the hill.</p>

<p>Slow, phantom-like, it crept along with no
sound but the rumbling and creaking that had
at first arrested the vicar’s attention.</p>

<p>Tregenna, on the alert at once, would have
descended the hill to find out what the monster
was. But at a sign from his daughter, Parson
Langney laid a restraining hand upon the
young man’s arm.</p>

<p>“What can you do—alone?” said he, warningly.
“Keep your heart in your breast for to-night,
at least. In the morning—why, you
must do your duty. Come, a tankard will do
you no harm. You shall drink ‘confusion to
free-traders’ if you will. And, egad, I’m inclined,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
after what I’ve heard, to drink the same
toast myself!”</p>

<p>Tregenna agreed, anxious for another chance
of a word with Joan. But he saw no more of
her that night. Even while the vicar was giving
this invitation, his daughter had slipped
quietly into the house, and disappeared for
the night.</p>

<p>This left Tregenna free to tell his host, over
the nut-brown ale which the vicar poured out
with loving hands, the whole story of the
adventures of the evening. Astounded, enthralled,
marveling at his daughter’s courage,
and furious at the smugglers’ daring outrage,
the vicar listened with all his ears.</p>

<p>And when the young man’s tone grew lower,
his eyes more passionate, as he declared his
love and admiration for the girl who had risked
so much for him, Parson Langney listened
sympathetically, and with tears in his eyes, to
the tale he had often indeed heard before, but
never from such eager lips.</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, she’s a good girl, a good girl, my
bonnie Joan!” said he, in a tremulous voice,
when Tregenna paused. “You’re not the first
that has come to me with this tale, sir, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
you’re the first she’s shown such kindness to as
she’s shown to you. But reckon not too much
on that, I warn you. She’s not your ordinary
lass, that minces and mouths, like the girls at
Hurst Court we’re going to dine with to-morrow.”
Tregenna made a mental note of this
fact, and determined that he would be invited
too. “And what she did and what she said
she’d have done and said for any other man in
such a plight as yours, I doubt not! But we’ll
see, we’ll see. I’m in no hurry to lose my Joan,
I promise you, sir. The day must come when
she’ll go forth from me as a bride; but there’s
time enough for that, time enough for that!
And I would not have you hope too much,
though I do not bid you despair.”</p>

<p>Tregenna was forced to be content with this
vague encouragement, and with the comfort of
having unburdened his heart to a sympathetic
ear. It was not long before he took his leave,
and having followed the vicar’s advice to concern
himself for that night with nothing but
his own safety, reached the boat in the creek
without accident, and was soon on board the
<i>Sea-Gull</i>.</p>

<p>Next morning he was early astir. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
already, on arriving on board, sent a trusty
messenger to Rye, to beg the brigadier to lose
no time in making a second expedition against
Rede Hall; he promised to meet him there,
and to put him in possession of some facts he
had learnt concerning its hiding-places.</p>

<p>But although it was no later than nine o’clock
in the morning when he and General Hambledon
met at the farmyard gates, they found that
the smugglers had been beforehand with them.</p>

<p>Not a man or a woman was to be found on
the premises; not a cow or a horse; not a pig
or a hen. And though the trap-door to the
cellar had been flung wide to assist them in
their search, it was in vain they sought for the
bales among which Tregenna had stood on
the previous night.</p>

<p>Not a keg or a bale was there in the whole
place, though they searched it from garret to
cellar!</p>

<p>The brigadier was ferociously facetious, tauntingly
jocose.</p>

<p>“Hey-day, Tregenna, I fear they gave thee
too much of their contraband <i>aqua vitæ</i>, and
that it has bred visions in thy brain!” said he,
with an ugly smile on his red face, and a vicious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
look in his eyes. He was in no very good
humor with the young man for having outrun
himself in zeal, and was at heart rather pleased
that this expedition, designed by his rival,
should have been as complete a failure as the
last.</p>

<p>“Well, at any rate, you see, General, that
there was something wrong with the place, for
them all to have deserted it like this,” said the
lieutenant, reasonably enough.</p>

<p>“More like they have deserted it from fear of
quarter-day!” retorted the brigadier. “’Tis
a common thing enough a flitting like to this,
at such seasons!”</p>

<p>“A least,” said Tregenna, who was hot and
furious at this fresh rebuff, “you will find the
ship under the barn-floor!”</p>

<p>But even as he uttered the words, a chill
seized him as he remembered, in a fresh light,
a mysterious incident of the previous evening.
He was, therefore, more disgusted than surprised
when, in searching the barn, the soldiers
discovered that the flooring was indeed loose, as
he had said, and that there was a crypt beneath:
but that though there were traces of the cradle in
which the smugglers’ boat had been hauled up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
and down, and some tools lying about in dark
corners with logs and screws, ropes and mallets,
the vessel itself had disappeared.</p>

<p>Tregenna took almost in silence the taunts
with which the brigadier now saluted him.
Leaving the soldiers to return to Rye, the
young man, with a shrewd suspicion that the
mammoth beast he had dimly seen crawling
through the village in the dark on the previous
evening was the smugglers’ boat, resolved to
try to track it to its new resting-place.</p>

<p>Such a weighty thing as the unfinished
vessel, and the wagon or wagons on which it
must have been removed, could not, he argued,
but have left its mark on the roads it
traversed.</p>

<p>And so it proved. Following the deep
wheelmarks which were easily discernible even
now in the mire of the Hurst road, he arrived
at that village, went through it, still tracing the
wheelmarks; and finally, to his consternation,
tracked the wagons to the stables of Hurst
Court.</p>

<p>It was a disconcerting discovery enough, but
Tregenna, furious at the conspiracy thus formed
against the representatives of law and order,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
did not scruple to follow it up. It was evident
that the hiding-place they had found for their
vessel had been looked upon by the smugglers
as safe and sacred, for no steps had been taken
to guard it. Tregenna opened the wide door
of the coach-house; and inside, as he had expected,
he saw the hull of the unfinished boat.</p>

<p>Without a moment’s loss of time he went
straight up to the house, where he fancied that
the butler who admitted him looked at him
askance, as if with some suspicion of his errand.</p>

<p>The squire himself, however, while affecting
the greatest astonishment and indignation
on hearing that the smugglers’ boat had been
placed in his stables, was evidently in a state of
extreme trepidation as to the course Tregenna
meant to pursue with regard to himself.</p>

<p>The lieutenant, however, thought it better to
receive his assurances of innocence as if he
believed them, thinking that this would be a
lesson strong enough to cure the squire of
complicity with the smugglers.</p>

<p>Squire Waldron was, of course, particularly
civil to his unwelcome guest, pressing him to
stay to dinner; an invitation which Tregenna
accepted at once, in the hope of meeting Joan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span></p>

<p>Then the squire made haste to rid himself
of his guest by presenting him to the ladies in
the music-room, who again, as on a previous
occasion, loaded him with hypocritical expressions
of horror at the smugglers and their
conduct. Certain rumors of the adventures
of the previous evening had reached their ears
from the Parsonage, and they all endeavored
to worm out of Tregenna the exact details of
his visit to Rede Hall, and of Joan’s late
ride.</p>

<p>“They do say, you must know, dear Mr.
Tregenna,” lisped one young lady, with a prim
little ghost of a malicious smile, “that Joan
Langney was so afraid you were gone to make
love to Ann Price, who is reckoned a great
beauty in these parts (though I am sure I ha’n’t
a notion why), that she cantered after you on
horseback!”</p>

<p>“The forward thing!” cried Miss Lucy.</p>

<p>“But maybe ’tis not true!” said Mrs. Waldron
inquisitively.</p>

<p>“Do, pray, tell us how ’twas, sir,” went on
Miss Alathea, playing affectedly with her fan.
“’Tis no breach of confidence; for you and she
were seen to return to the Parsonage together,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
late in the evening. So ’twill make the best of
a bad business to let us know the circumstances!”</p>

<p>“A bad business!” echoed Tregenna hotly.
“Nay, madam, ’twas a very good business for
me! Since, if Miss Joan had not been good
enough, knowing I was going thither, to ride to
Rede Hall and release me from what was
practically imprisonment at the hands of
the scoundrels who infest that place, I should
scarce have got hither alive!”</p>

<p>The young ladies both went off into a series
of little twittering shrieks, raising their hands
and turning up their eyes towards the painted
ceiling, with every mild expression of horror
and affright.</p>

<p>“So she <i>knew</i> you was going thither!”
chirped Miss Lucy presently. “You are great
friends at the Parsonage then, Mr. Tregenna?”</p>

<p>“I hope I am, madam,” returned Tregenna
promptly. “For there’s no friendship in the
world I value more than that of Miss Joan and
her father.”</p>

<p>This prompt declaration seemed rather to
damp the spirits of the two little pink-eyed
girls, and they desisted from their attacks in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
direction; and having obtained his assurance
that music was his passion, they proceeded to
the harpsichord and warbled monotonous little
duets to him until the arrival of Parson Langney
and his daughter brought a welcome relief from
the infliction.</p>

<p>Poor Tregenna, however, rather regretted
that he had been so prompt in accepting the
squire’s invitation, when he found how very
frigid Miss Joan was to him. She made him a
stately curtsey, with her eyelids lowered, and
without taking any notice of his proffered hand.
And when the parson, who had heard already
of the doings of the morning, twitted Tregenna
about the escape of the smugglers, Joan joined
heartily in his ironical comments while the
squire was not long in adding his taunts; so
that the young man found himself assailed on
all sides with no ally save the chirruping young
Waldron ladies, whose advocacy irritated him
more than did the attacks of Joan.</p>

<p>So mortified was he, indeed, that when the
ladies withdrew from the table, he felt that he
could not bear the society of the other three
gentlemen—his host, Bertram Waldron, and
the parson—any longer. He therefore made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
the excuse of his duties calling him away, and
left them to their wine.</p>

<p>Just as he was taking his three-cornered hat
from the peg in the hall where it hung, he
caught sight of one of the maids of the house,
in her smart frilled cap and neat muslin kerchief
and apron, in a corner of the hall. On seeing
him she started and turned to go back
and this action arrested his attention, and
caused him to look at her again.</p>

<p>The first look made him start; the second
made him stare; the third caused him to run
lightly across the hall, and to seize her by the
apron as she tried to escape into one of the
rooms.</p>

<p>“Ann Price—masquerading as a housemaid,
by all that’s audacious!” cried he, as they came
face to face.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent center small">A TRAITRESS.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Finding</span> escape impossible, Ann turned and
put a bold face on the matter. Or rather, she
turned indeed, and faced him, but with the
same air of modest womanliness which he had
before remarked in her when she wore her
sex’s clothes—a manner which altered so completely
as soon as she assumed the costume of
“Jem Bax.”</p>

<p>“And what are you pleased to want with
me, sir?” she asked respectfully, after the
short silence which had followed Tregenna’s
exclamation.</p>

<p>“Well, I want to know, in the first place,
what you are doing here?”</p>

<p>“Sure, sir, there’s no harm in my taking a
place as housemaid, now I’m turned out of
my mother’s home by your pryings of last
night.”</p>

<p>“’Tis rather a bad thing for the squire and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
his lady,” said Tregenna, dryly, “to be harboring
any of your kin, Ann, more especially
after my discovery in the coach-house this
morning!”</p>

<p>“I am not here, sir, as a smuggler, but as
a homeless farmer’s daughter,” returned Ann,
in the same modest, even tone. “I believe I
am reckoned worth my salt with a broom in
my hand, as well as in the dairy.”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, ’tis not for your services with
mop and churn they take you in, Ann, I know
that,” said Tregenna. “You would have done
best to keep out of my way a few days, after
your doings of last night. ’Tis not your fault
your rascally crew did not make an end to
me, when you sent them in pursuit of me, as
you did!”</p>

<p>“Nay, sir, if I did,” answered Ann, with a
sudden change to a soft voice and a pleading
manner which had in it something strangely
attractive, by reason of its unexpectedness,
“’twas done in the heat of unreasoning passion,
and without a thought of what grave consequences
it might bring upon you. If they
had really harmed you, by my troth I would
never have spoke to one of them again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span></p>

<p>“A very fair explanation, to be sure!” said
Tregenna, dryly. “But ’twas well I had the
luck to meet with a woman more womanly, to
counteract the effects of your solicitude on
my account.”</p>

<p>“You mean Miss Joan,” said Ann, in a very
quiet tone, as she played with the corner of
her apron, keeping her eyes fixed upon it all
the time.</p>

<p>“Whom should I mean but that most sweet
woman?” cried Tregenna, with the more enthusiasm
that Ann was evidently displeased by
his praise of the lady. “Had it not been for
her goodness, I should most surely have been
murdered last night, either by you or some
one of your villainous confederates.”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, sir, you would not,” returned
Ann, earnestly. “They would not have dared,
I say, not one of them, to do a hurt to one in
whom—in whom”—her voice faltered a little,
and she looked down, bending her head, so
that he could not see her face—“in whom I
had an interest!”</p>

<p>“An interest! Ay, truly, an interest so
strong that, at first sight of me, you did show
it at once by presenting a pistol at my head!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span></p>

<p>Ann suddenly raised her head, and looked
into his face with a steadfast earnestness which
could not but arrest his attention. In her
gray eyes there was a strange light, in her
whole manner a softness, both new and surprising.
Even her voice seemed to have lost
every trace of robust peasant harshness, and
to have become tender and melting.</p>

<p>“Sir, sir, you don’t understand! How can
I make you understand?” cried she passionately.</p>

<p>Then, as he looked into her face with
astonishment and curiosity, she suddenly
turned, walked a few steps towards a door
in the darkest part of the hall, and beckoned
him to follow her.</p>

<p>“Come hither, sir, out into the air!” said
she, in a low voice. “I am stifling here; I
want to feel the fresh wind on my face while
I speak.”</p>

<p>Her voice was full of strong emotion. Tregenna
paused an instant, suspecting treachery
in the strange woman; but she divined the
cause of his hesitation, and with a sudden
change to fire and pride, she said—</p>

<p>“You need not fear me. See, there is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
ambush prepared for you!” And as she spoke,
she threw open the door, and showed the way
into the beautiful old garden behind the
house.</p>

<p>Tregenna followed her in silence as she
went out, and took, without looking behind
her, the path that led, through winding walks,
and between quaint, stiff yew hedges, to the
Italian garden. There a broad terrace, with
a stone balustrade, led down to bright beds
of late autumn flowers, still pretty and fragrant,
though they were growing tall and straggling
at this late season, and were, in places,
nipped with the early frosts of the coming
winter.</p>

<p>Ann stopped on the terrace, and waited for
Tregenna to come up to her. When he did
so, she turned abruptly, and he was surprised
to see that she was in tears.</p>

<p>The discovery, in a woman of her fierce
attributes, was startling, amazing; and Tregenna
was disconcerted by it.</p>

<p>“You are astonished, I see, sir,” she began,
in the same gentle voice that he had last
heard from her, “to see a creature you have
always looked upon as masculine and hard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
with aught so feminine as a tear upon her
face!”</p>

<p>“Well, Miss Ann, I confess it, I am surprised.
I thought you were made of stuff too
stern for such weakness!”</p>

<p>“Did you but know more of me,” said she,
sadly, “you would not think so. We are all,
as you know, sir, made by our surroundings;
and see what mine have been! Brought up
from my earliest childhood among rough folk,
hearing of scenes that ’twould make your
blood run cold to relate, what chance had I to
grow into your soft and tender woman, that sits
and smiles, and screams at sight of a spider?”</p>

<p>“But surely there’s a wide difference between
screaming at a spider, on the one hand,
and using the weapons, ay, and the oaths of a
man, on the other?”</p>

<p>At this reproach, Ann became suddenly
red, and hung her head as if in shame.</p>

<p>“Nay, sir, ’tis true,” said she, almost below
her breath, “and I am shocked myself, when
I have leisure to reflect on’t, at the work I do,
and the words I utter, when my kinsmen have
stirred me up to fight their battles and to do
the deeds they demand of me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span></p>

<p>“Nay, ’tis, I think, rather they that do the
deeds you command. Jem Bax has the name
of being a leader on these occasions, and indeed
your own words have confirmed this!”</p>

<p>“’Tis true I have thrown in my lot with
them, hating myself the while; but ’tis not
true, sir, to say I have had aught but misery
and wretchedness in the doing of these deeds.
Does not your fine lady friend Miss Joan
speak well of me? Come, now, has she spoke
never a good word for me, in the discussions
I doubt not you have had on these matters?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she says you can be kind and
womanly, when you please; that you are
good to the poor and the sick; and that she
has a kind of liking for you, besides that she
feels for you as the daughter of one whom she
remembers tender to her in her childhood.”</p>

<p>Ann’s mobile face had grown, as she listened
to this speech, as happy and soft as a child’s.</p>

<p>“Ay, sir,” said she, “and ’tis the real Ann
of whom she speaks, the natural woman that
I would fain always be!”</p>

<p>“Give up your dealings with these folk,
then,” said Tregenna, eagerly, as he sat on the
balustrade, and looked at her with earnest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
eyes. “Listen to the promptings of your
better nature, and in yielding to your own
good instincts you will be helping not only
yourself, but your kinsfolk out of harm! Remember,
you cannot fight forever such forces
as will be brought against you and your lawless
traffic. Yield then while there is a grace
in yielding, and wait not for the strong hand
of the law to get hold of you, and to mow you
down!”</p>

<p>While he spoke with fire and excitement,
moved by her emotion and deeply interested
in the wayward woman, Ann had drawn gradually
nearer to him, until her strong hand
touched his as it lay on the balustrade. Her
eyes, still soft and dewy with tears, sought his
for an instant from time to time, as if in shyness,
all the more attractive from her reputed
character for fierce disdain.</p>

<p>When he ceased speaking, she sighed
deeply, and then seemed to become suddenly
possessed by a spirit of daring and desperation.</p>

<p>Drawing herself up, and peering closely into
his handsome face, she said quickly—</p>

<p>“Sir, sir, you know not how you move me!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
I have never felt before as I feel in listening
to you. You make me hate my own folk, with
their villainies and their rough ways, kinswoman
and confederate of theirs though I have been!
Oh, sir, I feel, I know, that you are better than
we, that we are but the nest of robbers and
pirates you say, that we deserve no mercy at
your hands!”</p>

<p>Passionate, earnest as she was, Tregenna
kept his head sufficiently to be skeptical about
this sudden appearance of conversion.</p>

<p>He drew back, almost imperceptibly, a little
way, and said, in a cooler tone—</p>

<p>“And I fear ’tis little mercy some of you
will get, when a stronger force is sent down to
ferret your leaders out!”</p>

<p>“But you would make distinctions, sir, would
you not?” said she, with tremulous eagerness.
“You would not, for sure, deal with the lad
Tom, poor Tom that you have lamed for life,
as hardly as with some others?”</p>

<p>“Those that have done the worst will be
the most harshly dealt with, certainly,” said
Tregenna.</p>

<p>“Ay, and none too harshly either, for some
of them! villains, thieves, plunderers that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
be! See here, sir”—and her tone dropped
again to a whisper, as she came quite close to
him, and laid one hand almost caressingly on
his sleeve—“there’s no sympathy in my heart
for them that would have done you harm, no,
nor for the man that murdered that poor coastguardsman
when first you came hither! I love
not such folks, sir, whatever you may think
of me! And see, sir, to prove to you how
earnestly I do grieve for the ill they have done,
I am ready to give you up the murderer of the
coastguardsman into your hand, ay, for I know
who ’twas that did it, and I can put you in the
way of evidence to prove it too!”</p>

<p>Tregenna started and flushed. He had not
the least doubt that this woman could indeed
do as she offered to do, that she could deliver
the murderer into the hands of justice. But
he shrank from accepting her suggestion, not
only with instinctive mistrust of a woman who
was ready to deliver up her own lover, but with
not unnatural suspicion that she might be a
traitress to both sides.</p>

<p>So he got off the balustrade, and said
coldly—</p>

<p>“I thank you, Mistress, for your offer: but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
believe the hands of justice will need no more
aid than they have got!”</p>

<p>Then Ann, without any appearance of ill-feeling,
laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Maybe the hands of justice are less powerful
than you think, sir,” said she. “But, at any
rate, I hope you will think kindly of the woman
who, for your sake, was ready to risk her safety,
nay, her life maybe, to help you!”</p>

<p>As she spoke, in a tone of inexpressible
tenderness, she came very near to the young
lieutenant, and gazed into his face with a look
so melting, so passionate, that he was stirred,
fascinated, in a very high degree. It was impossible
to be cold to her, however great his
innermost disapproval of her might be. He
had bent his head to reply, when a footstep on
the gravel behind the yew-hedge, followed by a
loud outburst of laughter, caused him to start,
and to look round.</p>

<p>Peering at the pair through a gap in the
hedge he saw the face of young Bertram
Waldron, flushed with wine, twisted into
malevolent contortions of coarse amusement.</p>

<p>“Ho, ho, ho!” laughed the young cub,
“here’s sport, egad! I’ll wager she gives you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
a smack o’ the face before she’s done, like to
the one she gave me but this morning.”</p>

<p>Tregenna made but one step in his direction
when Bertram prudently retired; and they heard
his cracked laugh as he went rapidly back to
the house.</p>

<p>It was some moments before Tregenna and
Ann could resume their interrupted conversation.
Indeed, Tregenna was anxious to break
it off altogether, but Ann persisted, following
him as he turned to move away, and detaining
him with a gesture which was half peremptory,
half imploring.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, sir, you’ll give me a hearing, at
least,” said she, earnestly, “if ’twere but for
the safety of your friends. And I could tell you of
a plot that’s been formed whereby your crew
would be the sufferers, to an extent would
rend your heart. Ay, ’tis true!” she added,
as he turned incredulously towards her.</p>

<p>“There’s little need of a special plot,” said
he, “since we all know the whole neighborhood’s
in league against us!”</p>

<p>“And for that reason you should be all the
more willing to lend your ear, when you have
at last found a friend ready to afford you assistance!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
persisted Ann. “And better assistance
than your Miss Joan could give, I’ll warrant me!”</p>

<p>Just as she spoke these words, in a tone
which betrayed some pique, Tregenna raised
his head on hearing the sound of a rustling
silken gown on the walk above: and there, between
the hedges, with the malicious face of
Bertram Waldron appearing behind her, he
saw Joan Langney herself, with a look of proud
astonishment on her beautiful face.</p>

<p>The mischievous young man had brought
her out into the garden on some pretext, evidently;
for it was plain she had not expected
to see either Tregenna or Ann.</p>

<p>The moment he caught sight of her, Tregenna
made a hasty excuse to Ann, and mounting
the stone steps from the terrace in a couple
of strides, addressed Joan just as she was in the
act of turning away.</p>

<p>“Miss Joan, a moment, I beg!” said he.</p>

<p>Bertram giggled; but on Tregenna’s turning
sharply to him with a gesture of angry dismissal,
the cub retreated, and, with a clumsy air
of being at his ease, retired quickly to the
house. Ann also, with a short, hard laugh,
disappeared among the yew-hedges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span></p>

<p>Thus left alone with the girl he loved, the
young lieutenant was not slow in seizing the
opportunity he had so long wished for; and
although she tried to leave him and to return
to the house, he gave her a look so full of entreaty,
as he mutely placed himself in her way,
and gazed at her with an expression there was
no mistaking, that she faltered, paused, and
asked, in a low voice—</p>

<p>“What have you, sir, to say to me? I had
no notion of meeting you here.”</p>

<p>“Surely, Miss Joan, if you could give ten
minutes of your conversation to that booby
young Waldron, you might bestow the same
favor on me!”</p>

<p>“’Twas from no liking for Mr. Waldron I
came out,” said Joan, hastily. “He lured me
hither by saying I should see something very
interesting in the Italian garden; and I thought
he had some rare flower or bird to show me.
I should scarce have come, as you may guess,
to see you in such interesting converse with
Ann Price!”</p>

<p>In her voice, Tregenna was delighted to notice
a tone of pique which seemed to be of
good augury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span></p>

<p>“There was naught of great import in my
talk with her,” said he, quickly. He was
trembling so much that his sword rattled at his
side, and his voice was as hoarse as a raven’s.
“But ’tis true I have something of great import
to me on my mind, and I cannot but think,
Miss Joan, you must know what it is!”</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir, I cannot guess your thoughts!”
said Joan, though the heightened color in her
cheeks belied her words.</p>

<p>“Can you not imagine what I feel—what I
could not—dared not, say last night? Oh, you
do, you must, I think! Sure a man cannot
feel what I feel for you without its getting from
his heart into his eyes! Don’t you know I love
you, Joan?”</p>

<p>The change came about in the space of a
second. When the last hurried words, husky,
tremulous, half whispered, came bursting from
his lips, Joan shivered, gave him one glance,
and had betrayed herself before she was
aware.</p>

<p>“You—you care for Ann!” she faltered
between two long-drawn breaths.</p>

<p>“Pshaw! Not I! I care for Joan. I care
for Joan, only Joan!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span></p>

<p>And at the last word, as she hardly resisted
him, he kissed her.</p>

<p>It was growing cold even in the sheltered
garden, now that the late autumn sun was descending
in the sky, and the wind was rising
and sending the red leaves fluttering from the
boughs of the trees to the earth. But they
never heeded it: they would have gone on sitting
on that terrace, and walking round and
round those flower-beds, for an hour and more,
had not Parson Langney’s voice presently
startled them by calling—</p>

<p>“Joan, Joan, my lass, where art thou?”</p>

<p>The girl gave one frightened glance at her
lover, forbade him to follow her and speak to
her father till she had prepared the way, and
fled away like an arrow from a bow.</p>

<p>Happy and excited with the joy of successful
love, Tregenna was sauntering round the
house towards a side-gate out of the park, when
Ann’s voice startled him.</p>

<p>He knew not whence she had sprung; but
she was looking at him from out a clump of
bushes with a strange smile on her pallid face.</p>

<p>As he started, she burst into a low, mocking
laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span></p>

<p>“Ay, sir, kiss while you can; speak low
when there’s a fair maid to listen. But the
game’s not played out yet!”</p>

<p>Upon those words, with a flashing look from
her great somber gray eyes, she disappeared
abruptly.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span></p>
<h2 id="Ch_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent center small">AN INNOCENT RIVAL.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Now</span>, although Harry Tregenna was in a
state of mind more nearly approaching perfect
bliss than he had ever been before, with the
knowledge that Joan Langney loved him fresh
upon him, he could not but feel an uncanny
chill when Ann Price uttered her mocking
words of warning.</p>

<p>“The game’s not played out yet!”</p>

<p>He would have followed her, questioned
her. But she knew every turn in the park
much better than he; and after a few moments
spent in looking for her, he gave up the search
as an idle one.</p>

<p>After all, what could she do? Desperate
and vindictive as he knew her to be, she could
hardly go the length of trying to harm generous-hearted
Joan. And as for what she
might choose to attempt on his own person,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
Tregenna was ready to take the risks of war,
which, indeed, could hardly be greater in the
future than they had been in the past.</p>

<p>So he presently dismissed all thought of her,
and gave himself up, heart and soul, to joyful
thoughts of the beautiful, brave girl he had
won. He lingered about for a little while,
to give her time to break the news to her father,
as she had herself wished to do. And when
he thought they must have reached home, he
turned his steps also in the direction of the
Parsonage.</p>

<p>By the wistful look of emotion on Parson
Langney’s rugged, kindly face, by the moisture
in his eyes, the young man guessed that he
had already been made aware that he was
threatened with the loss of his fair daughter:
and the first words he uttered, as he held
out a shaking hand in welcome, confirmed
this impression:</p>

<p>“So you’re going to take her away from me!
Well, well, ’tis the way of all flesh!”</p>

<p>Tregenna assured him that they were in no
hurry, that he was ready to wait any reasonable
time: a week, a month, any period they might
choose. He further assured the vicar that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
would leave the service, and promised to settle
down with his wife at no very great distance
from Hurst Parsonage.</p>

<p>And although Parson Langney shook his head
very lugubriously, and grumbled at the folly
of a woman’s marrying before she was thirty,
his jolly face soon grew brighter when Joan
came in, and, putting her arms round his neck
under her lover’s very nose, assured him that
he was the nicest and handsomest man in the
whole world, and that, if she were driven to
get married, it should only be on compulsion,
and on receiving her future husband’s assurance
that she was her father’s girl still, and might
be with him as much as she liked.</p>

<p>So they had a happy evening together, and
when the young lieutenant bade them good
night, and started on his way back to his boat,
it was with never a thought of smugglers, or
wreckers, builders of secret boats, or treacherous
farmers’ daughters, to damp his spirits.</p>

<p>There was a lull in the contraband traffic
after these events, and Tregenna and the brigadier
began to flatter themselves that their
energy had at last awed the smugglers into
submission, when one day the news was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
brought to the lieutenant that the same sloop
which had been in sight on the occasion of the
last raid, was hovering about in the distance.</p>

<p>A sharp lookout was accordingly kept that
night, but nothing happened to justify their
suspicions. On the following day, however, a
light mist sprang up, and not long afterwards
they were able to discover that, under cover of
it, there was a boat making at a great rate for
the beach at Hastings.</p>

<p>The smugglers—for Tregenna had little
doubt of the nature of the boat’s errand—had a
good start of the cutter’s men; but the latter
gave chase at once in one of their own boats,
and were soon justified in their surmise; for,
on grounding their craft as soon as they could
on the pebbly shore, the occupants of the pursued
boat deliberately emptied it of its contents
in sight of their pursuers, and leaving it
to its fate, ran up the beach towards the narrow
streets of the old town, each with a couple of
kegs slung round him, the one in front, and the
other behind.</p>

<p>They did not fail, as they went, to bid a
graceful adieu to Tregenna and his men, waving
their rough knitted caps and shouting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
“Good-by” as they disappeared through the
openings between the houses.</p>

<p>Straining every nerve, the cutter’s men
grounded their own boat in an incredibly short
time; and, profiting by the precious moments
the smugglers had lost in emptying their
cargo, they raced up the stony beach in pursuit,
believing that, encumbered as they were,
the “free-traders” would find it impossible to
keep ahead of them long.</p>

<p>But alas! they had reckoned without their
host; for while they, the representatives of
law and order, were fighting alone and unaided,
the smugglers had each a brother or a mother,
a sister or a sweetheart, in one or other of the
mean, picturesque little hovels that nestled together
in the shelter of the tall cliffs beneath
the castle, and lined the narrow, tortuous streets
of the ancient town.</p>

<p>No sooner had the first of the revenue-men
turned the corner into the High Street, up
which the smugglers were making their way
towards some chosen haunt of their own, than
the hindermost of the rascals, who alone carried
no burden, gave a peculiar kind of shrill
whistle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span></p>

<p>This was evidently the recognized method
of giving an alarm to the rest, and was also the
signal for the inhabitants of the squalid little
houses to be on the alert.</p>

<p>Already every door was standing open, showing,
to the exasperation of the king’s men, a
group of eager, grinning faces, intent on the
sport.</p>

<p>The moment the whistle sounded, the smugglers
who carried the kegs divested themselves
each of one of his burdens, and rolled it towards
the nearest open cottage-door. The
moment the keg was safe inside, the door
closed.</p>

<p>The smuggler, having thus got rid of one of
his kegs, went on at a quicker pace for a few
steps, and then, on the sounding of a second
whistle, got rid of the remaining one in the
same way.</p>

<p>Well used to this maneuver, which was a
common one at the time, those of the cottage-folk
who had not received one of the contraband
kegs, closed their doors also; so that Tregenna
and his men, on reaching the point in
the street where this trick had been played,
found it impossible to identify any particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
house as one of those which had lent the use
of its portal to the smugglers.</p>

<p>A few half frightened, half mocking children
stood about in the road; but at the windows
not a single face was to be seen.</p>

<p>Tregenna, who was at the head of the pursuing
force, saw, to his chagrin, that it was now
impossible for him to hope to come up with
the smugglers. Lightened of their burdens,
and already well ahead of their pursuers, they
flew like the wind up the steep street towards
the old church, without so much as looking
behind them to give the cutter’s men a chance
of seeing and remembering their faces.</p>

<p>At this point in the route, however, they all
somewhat abruptly disappeared, with the exception
of the one who had given the signal.</p>

<p>From his limping gait, Tregenna had long
since recognized him as “Gardener Tom,” and
he felt at the first moment rather sorry that
this man, the only one of the “free-traders”
for whom he felt the slightest kindness, should
be the only one to fall into his hands.</p>

<p>It was not until he had reached the queer
little irregular group of nestling houses clustering
round the church, that Tom suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
turned, put his back against the steep wall
which banked up the houses on one side of
the roadway, folded his arms, and waited for
Tregenna to come up to him.</p>

<p>The lieutenant, expecting that Tom had a
pistol ready for him, put his hand to one of
his own. The smuggler, however, shook his
head, and held up his hands.</p>

<p>“Where are the rest?” cried Tregenna, more
by instinct than because he expected a useful
answer.</p>

<p>Tom, whose handsome, open face was flushed
with his exertions, smiled mockingly at him.</p>

<p>“Wheer? Wheer?” asked he, with a shake
of the head. “Nay, master, look round, and
see if ’twill be easy for you to light upon ’em
now!”</p>

<p>Tregenna did look round. He saw the close-packed
cottages, some prim and neat, with a
sort of look about them as if no creature within
had ever heard of so terrible a thing as a
smuggler: some dirty and neglected, and capable
of anything: but all shut up, and without
a human face at any window. One mean-looking
little alehouse at the corner did certainly
bear a sort of rakish, contraband look.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
But a peep within its doors showed that the
landlord and one old man had it, to all appearances,
to themselves.</p>

<p>Tregenna sighed, and frowned.</p>

<p>“Well, I must arrest you, Tom, and carry
you off at least,” said he.</p>

<p>“I be smuggling naught, master!” objected
Tom, quite mildly.</p>

<p>“You were signalman to the others,” answered
Tregenna. “You’re one of the gang.”</p>

<p>Tom took this very quietly.</p>

<p>“All roight, take me if you will,” said he.
“’Twas you, sir, that gave me the hurt makes
me too lame to get away!” said he.</p>

<p>Tregenna frowned, and looked uneasily round
at his own men, who, deeming him quite able
to cope with this, the only one of the ruffians
whom they had in their power, had dispersed
in various directions, engaged in the rather
hopeless task of ferreting out their lost enemies.</p>

<p>“I’d sooner have caught any one of the
others, Tom,” said Tregenna, “than laid hands
on thee.”</p>

<p>“And I,” replied Tom, with a glance round
in his tone, and a lowering of the voice, “I’d
sooner I was caught by you, sir, than as any of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
the others was! For I’ve summat for to say
to you, sir, summat for to arst you!”</p>

<p>And over Tom’s open ruddy face there passed
an expression of deep anxiety.</p>

<p>“To ask me, Tom? Well?”</p>

<p>“Oons, sir you’d tell me the truth, wouldn’t
you? You’d be above telling lies to a poor
fellow loike me!” went on the young man,
wistfully.</p>

<p>Tregenna looked amazed, as well he might,
at this most unexpected speech.</p>

<p>“I hope, Tom,” said he, “I’m above telling
lies to any one.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, it’s loike to this ’ere: you han’t
forgot, sir, that noight as you came to Rede
Hall, have you?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not likely to forget that quickly!”</p>

<p>“You’ll moind, sir, how ’twas Ann Price sent
us after thee, in a passion.”</p>

<p>“Ay, I’m not like to forget that either, Tom,
nor your treatment of me when you came up
with me!”</p>

<p>Tom looked down, reddening.</p>

<p>“Oons, sir,” said he, gruffly, “we’re rough
customers, I know. But we had more than
one account to settle with you, sir; and you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
see, you’d found out a bit too much to be let
off loight! We had to turn out of the place
where we’d met together for years, all along
of you and your findings. And that wasn’t all
neither!”</p>

<p>And a significant frown puckered his brows
once more.</p>

<p>“Why, what other harm have I done you,
than what I had to do in the course of my
duty?” asked Tregenna.</p>

<p>“You’d gotten the roight side of Ann!”
growled Ann’s lover, angrily.</p>

<p>“The right side! Nay, then I know not
what getting the wrong side would be like!”
retorted Tregenna, lightly. “For there’s no
sort of ill treatment, short of actual murder,
that I have not received at her hands, and I
own I never meet her without watching her
hands, to be sure she holds not a knife
concealed in some fold of her dress, wherewith
to stab me!”</p>

<p>“Ay, that’s Ann all over!” said her lover,
admiringly. “She’s got such a spirit, has Ann!
But it’s just them ways of hers with you that
makes me know she looks upon you with too
koind an eye, sir. She loikes you, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
hates herself for loiking a king’s man, that’s
what it is!”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said the young lieutenant, with a
laugh. “Then I assure you, Tom, she’s vastly
welcome to transfer her liking to some one else;
for it’s wasted on me!”</p>

<p>Tom scanned the speaker’s face narrowly,
and then drew a long breath of relief.</p>

<p>“You speak as if it was truth,” said he,
at last, in a muttering tone. “Then, maybe,
sir,” he went on, with deep earnestness, still
keeping an anxious gaze upon Tregenna’s
face, “maybe you don’t know where she is
now?”</p>

<p>He seemed to wait with breathless eagerness
for the answer.</p>

<p>“Most surely I do not,” replied Tregenna,
promptly, “if she be not at Hurst Court, where
I saw her near ten days ago.”</p>

<p>Tom shook his head.</p>

<p>“She ben’t there now, sir. Nobody hereabouts
has a notion where she’s got to; so I
thought as maybe it was you had spirited her
away.”</p>

<p>“God forbid!” said Tregenna, heartily.
“My good fellow, set your mind at rest. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
there’s one man in the world less likely than
another to spirit away your friend Ann Price,
or indeed to have aught to do with her, ’gad,
’tis I!”</p>

<p>Tom passed his hand over his chin reflectively:
he did not yet seem satisfied.</p>

<p>“Faith, man, what further assurance do you
want?” said Tregenna, amused at the fellow’s
persistency. “Dost still think I’m in love with
thy fair friend the amazon?”</p>

<p>“Nay, sir that I do not,” replied Tom,
slowly. “But ’tis her that’s in love with thee!
And, sure, she’s more loike to have her way
with thee, than ever thou wouldst ha’ been to
make way with her, if so be it had been t’other
way round!”</p>

<p>“Make yourself easy on that point also,”
answered Tregenna, now laughing heartily at
the young man’s fears. “Mistress Ann would
get no soft words from me, no loving looks, and
no fond embraces, were I the only man left on
the earth, and she the only woman!”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Tom, not a bit relieved by the
assurance, “I do believe you mean what you
say. But she’s no common woman, isn’t Ann;
and since she’s sworn she’ll have your kisses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
within the month, why, I do surely believe
she’ll get them, whether you will or no.”</p>

<p>“Sworn to have my kisses!” echoed the
lieutenant, in amazement. “Egad, then, she’ll
be forsworn. Fear not, man; thy fair one has
no charms for me, and truly she hath never met
a man less like to bestow his kisses upon her.
Where she is gone I know not: and if I were
in thy shoes, I should be thankful she’d disappeared,
and I should look about for something
softer, something more like a woman, to
whom to give my kindness!”</p>

<p>“Sir, one cannot give love where one will!”
said poor Tom, rather ruefully. “If I do know
why I love her, ’tis on account of her not
being loike to every other lass in the parish;
to her being so different from herself, as from
all other women, that one never knows how
she’s going for to be two hours together! So it
ain’t no good of talking, sir; for, oons! I’ve
loved her too long to go trapesing after another
now!”</p>

<p>At that moment Tregenna caught sight of
the first of his own men returning from a fruitless
search for the rest of the smugglers. He
turned quickly to Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span></p>

<p>“Tom,” said he, “I cannot deal harshly
with thee; get away with thee ere it be too
late. For these fellows of mine dare not show
so much leniency as I am doing.”</p>

<p>Tom took the hint. He was artful enough
to make a feint of striking the lieutenant, making
a movement which caused the latter to
take an instinctive step backward, as if he had
really been pushed aside. Tom then made a
dash for the nearest opening between the
houses; and being still wonderfully active
when he chose to exert himself, he was lost to
the sight of the cutter’s men in a few seconds.</p>

<h2 id="Ch_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent center small">A PRISONER.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">It</span> was useless to pursue the smugglers any
longer, and equally useless to make any plans
for seizing them on land on their way back to
the sloop. As they had friends all along the
coast, it was very certain that they would make
no attempt to re-embark from the beach at
Hastings, but would reach the ship from some
other point of the shore.</p>

<p>All that Tregenna could do, therefore, was
to seize the boat they had left upon the beach,
and then to return to the cutter. Here he
learnt that the sloop had sailed away under
cover of the mist, so that there was nothing
for it but to take their chance of falling in with
her crew on their way back to her.</p>

<p>When night came on, therefore, a couple
of boats, with Tregenna in one of them, left
the cutter and cruised about, the one on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
Hastings side, the other in the direction of the
marshes.</p>

<p>Tregenna was in the former boat; but it had
not got very far when one of the men at the
oars raised his head, as if listening intently.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that, sir?” asked he, in a
low voice.</p>

<p>“What? I heard nothing.”</p>

<p>The man rested on his oar, and his example
was followed by the others. There was a
moment of dead silence, no sounds reaching
their straining ears but the cry of a sea-bird
and the soft plash of the calm water as it
lapped the sides of the boat. It was a beautiful
night, the sea as smooth as a lake, and
the moon, which was almost at the full, making
a bright path of silvery yellow on the still
water. There was nothing to tell of early
winter save for a touch of frost in the air,
and a thin line of November fog along the
shore.</p>

<p>Suddenly there rang out in the keen night
air the sharp report of a pistol, followed by a
cry, which sounded shrill in the distance.</p>

<p>“Turn,” said Tregenna, “and row hard for
the other boat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span></p>

<p>As they went, pulling with all their strength,
they heard nothing more for some time. It
was not until they had come in sight of their
second boat that they perceived that a stern
chase was in progress.</p>

<p>Well out to sea, and rowing out at a rapid
rate, was a long, low craft which was painted
a light color, and which it was easy to guess
was the property of the “free-traders.” It was
much longer than either of the pursuing craft,
lightly built, and well manned. So that singly
one of the cutter’s boats and its small crew
would have had little chance with it, had the
two come to close quarters.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the revenue-men were giving
chase with a will, and at sight of their comrades
on the way to join them they gave forth a
cheer which rang out over the water, putting
spirit into the heart of their comrades, and
vigor into their strokes.</p>

<p>As the answering cheer came forth from the
throats of Tregenna and his crew, a shout of
hoarse, mocking laughter, mingled with oaths
and foul threats, came in a volley from the
smugglers’ craft; and the next moment, finding
that the two opposing boats were gaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
on her, she swung round and waited for them
to come up with her.</p>

<p>Tregenna’s boat was now the nearer of the
two. In the moonlight the lieutenant saw a face,
coarse, evil, with eyes aflame, peering over the
side of the smuggler’s craft from under one of
the knitted caps the most of them wore: it
was that of Ben the Blast. The next moment
the rascal raised his right arm, and pointed a
pistol at him.</p>

<p>The rest of the smugglers were all crouching,
like Ben, round the sides of the boat. Suddenly
there sprang up above their heads the
slighter, more lithe figure, in open jacket and
loose shirt-collar, which Tregenna had so much
reason to remember. Even at that moment
of excitement, the thought that this was a
woman who stood exposed to his own fire and
that of his men made Tregenna feel for a moment
sick and faint. Before he had recovered
from the effects of his recognition of Ann Price
in the guise of “Jem Bax,” he saw her strike
a violent blow at Ben’s right arm: and the
upraised pistol dropped into the water.</p>

<p>Then there came a cry from the crew of the
second cutter’s boat; in the last few moments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
they had gained on their comrades, and it was
they who first came up with the smugglers.</p>

<p>Over Tregenna there had suddenly come a
frightful sense of a new and sickening danger,
that of killing a woman in open fight. Unsexed
creature as she had seemed, when he
had heard her cursing and uttering threats
against him at the farmhouse, he could not but
remember, at this fearful moment, how she
had conversed with him in the garden at Hurst
Court, with all the sweet tones and soft looks,
the pleading words and winning ways, of a
very woman.</p>

<p>The feeling was paralyzing; it went near to
making a coward of him. Then, just as his
boat was drawing in its turn alongside that of
the smugglers, he saw one of his own men,
from the other boat, in actual conflict with
“Jem.”</p>

<p>He saw the gleam of knives; he saw the two
boats rocking like cradles on the surface of the
water. Then it was “Jem” who uttered a cry;
the red blood gushed forth over the white
shirt she wore, and the next moment she staggered,
and fell, not back into her comrades’
boat but into that of the revenue-men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span></p>

<p>At that moment Tregenna’s attention was
recalled to his own situation by his receiving
a blow on the breast from a weapon in the
hands of one of the smugglers. The attack recalled
him to himself, roused again the savage
instinct which is the best for a man to feel at
such a time, and nerved his arm to retaliation.</p>

<p>He saw no more of “Jem;” he was able,
therefore, in the excitement of the fight, to forget
her. And, although the smuggler’s boat
presently succeeded in sheering off, after having
inflicted some damage on their opponents,
it was with more than one of their number
hurt and disabled that they made off in the
direction of the sloop.</p>

<p>Tregenna would have followed; but to the
signals he made to his second boat to accompany
him, the crew replied that they were unable
to do so. He had, therefore, to be content
with the damage he had undoubtedly inflicted
upon the “free-traders,” and to return to the
cutter, which he reached some minutes before
the second boat did.</p>

<p>When this came up, in its turn, the boatswain,
who was in charge of it, saluted, in some
triumph, as he drew alongside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span></p>

<p>Tregenna was looking over the side, anxious
to learn whether his men had suffered
much.</p>

<p>“Sir,” called out the boatswain, cheerily,
“I’ve good news for you!”</p>

<p>“Well, and what is it?” asked the lieutenant,
as he scanned, with some bewilderment,
a sort of heap which lay in the bows of the
little boat.</p>

<p>“Oons, sir, we’ve brought a prisoner along,”
answered the boatswain, in a ringing voice.
“And wounded beside. And ’tis none other
than Jem Bax, that’s long been known as the
biggest rascal of the lot!”</p>

<p>Instead of receiving this intelligence with
the delight and congratulations which the hero
of the capture evidently expected, Tregenna
uttered a sound which was very like a groan,
and exclaimed, in a most lugubrious voice—</p>

<p>“The devil you have!”</p>

<p>The boatswain, startled and disappointed,
looked at his captain in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Plague on’t, sir, but I thought I’d done
the smartest night’s work ever fell to my lot!”
cried he.</p>

<p>“Take him back!” roared Tregenna, as soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
as he caught the first sight of the white face
he had so much reason to remember.</p>

<p>The boatswain had uncovered the heap in
the bows, exposing to view the prostrate form
of “Jem Bax,” who lay, with closed eyes, and
with blood-stains on face and breast, limp,
motionless, helpless, without giving a sign of
life.</p>

<p>Tregenna’s face and voice changed at the
sight.</p>

<p>“Well, haul him up,” said he, with a sudden
change to anxiety, as the thought struck him
that Ann was perhaps already dead. “We’ll
see what we can do for the fellow!”</p>

<p>None of the others had, apparently, the least
suspicion that “Jem Bax” was a woman; and
Tregenna intended to keep the secret to himself
if he could, and to get rid of her as fast as
possible.</p>

<p>There was something so ridiculous in having
caught such a prisoner that he would not for
worlds have had the truth suspected.</p>

<p>They raised the still motionless body to the
level of the cutter’s deck, and Tregenna himself
knelt down to examine the injuries of the
seemingly unconscious prisoner. The men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
would have taken her below; but Tregenna,
whose great anxiety was, after seeing to her
wounds, to get rid of her as quickly as he could,
without discovery of her sex, desired them to
leave her where she lay, at any rate for the time,
and threw his own cloak over her, while he
sought the wound which had reduced her to this
condition.</p>

<p>He could find nothing but a superficial cut
near the collar-bone, which had indeed bled
freely, but scarcely to such an extent, to judge
by appearances, as to have produced insensibility.
Further examination disclosed a large
bruise on the upper part of the right arm; but
this seemed to be the full extent of her
injuries.</p>

<p>It was not unnatural that Tregenna, knowing
the artful character of the woman, should
come to the conclusion that she was shamming
sick to some extent, and that her injuries
were not alone the cause of this excessive
prostration.</p>

<p>He dismissed his men, therefore, and performed
for her the same office that had fallen
to him before, by producing his flask of <i>aqua
vitæ</i>, and holding it to her lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span></p>

<p>He did not, however, on this occasion,
bestow so much patience or so much tenderness
upon her as he had done before. As
soon as the men had retired far enough for
him not to risk being overheard, he said in
her ear—</p>

<p>“Come, Jem, ’tis vastly well done, but ’tis
wasted on me this time!”</p>

<p>Very little to his surprise, she opened her
eyes immediately, and said, but in a faint
husky voice—</p>

<p>“I did but wait till I could speak with you
alone, sir. I am dying—I am bleeding within—I
know it, I feel it—But I care not. So I
die in your arms, or, at least, with you by me, I
care naught: I shall die happy!”</p>

<p>As she spoke, her great, weird gray eyes
unnaturally large in appearance through the
drawn expression of her features and the utter
absence of color from her cheeks and lips,
were fixed intently upon his face.</p>

<p>Although he reproached himself for the
suspicion, Tregenna did at first ask himself
whether this speech, moving as it was meant to
be, were not part of the deception she had
intended throughout to play upon him. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
before he could utter a word in answer, she
said, looking at him reproachfully the while—</p>

<p>“You doubt me, sir; I can see it in your
face! But, tell me, did I not stay the hand
of Ben the Blast, when he would have shot
you down? Did you not see how I caused his
pistol to fall into the water? Wherefore should
I have acted so, I, who can fight as well as I—
can love, but for some feeling for you which
was not that of an enemy.”</p>

<p>“’Tis true you saved me from that bullet,
and I am grateful, Ann,” said Tregenna. “And
I will hope you think too gravely of your own
case, and that I may soon be able to send you
back on shore. Drink this, drink it, and it will,
I hope, put some life into you, some warmth,
as it did before!”</p>

<p>The reminder brought a tinge of color to
Ann’s white face.</p>

<p>“Raise my head with your arm then, sir,”
said she, “and I will drink, since ’tis you who
bid me!”</p>

<p>She gave him another long look, passionate,
earnest, full of a strange, mysterious pain.
Then, having sipped the cordial, she drew a
long breath, as if its potency were too great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
for her in her weakened state, and whispered—</p>

<p>“I have something to ask you, sir, before—I—die!”
Her voice failed her on the last
words, and he had to wait a little before she
gained strength enough to go on. “Will you
promise that, when the breath has gone out
of my body, you will let me lie here, in the
open air, and with your cloak over me, till the
morning? Nay, sure, sir,” she went on feebly,
as Tregenna would have spoken, “you can’t
refuse me so small a boon!”</p>

<p>She clutched at his hand as she spoke, and
held it with a convulsive grip, as he answered
her.</p>

<p>“You shall stay here, if you please,” said
he. “But do not give way. You are young,
and strong: you will live yet, I doubt not. I
can see no wound upon you that should lead
to your death!”</p>

<p>“None the less,” said she, as she tried to
shake her head, “I shall die. And I am glad
of it, since my body, in death, shall lie where
I would have it lie, in Heaven’s sweet air, and
on your ship, yours.” She pronounced the
last word with inexpressible tenderness, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
turned upon him, as she spoke, a look so moving,
so piercing in its wistfulness, that the
tears sprang to Tregenna’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Kiss me,” said she quickly. “Kiss me,
once, kiss me twice, and thrice—before I
die!”</p>

<p>As she uttered these words, in a hoarse and
broken voice, she strove to raise herself, and
lifted her white and eager face to his.</p>

<p>He obeyed her, kissing her three times, not
with the feeling that it was a dying woman
whose lips touched his, but with a horrible,
uncanny sense of contact with some being
that was not honest flesh and blood. It
seemed to him that her dry lips burned, seared
his, as if he had been touched by red-hot coals.</p>

<p>It was with difficulty that he repressed a
shudder as she let him go. She fixed upon
him her dark gray eyes, to which the black
lines sunk beneath gave a strange brilliancy;
then suddenly her head fell forward upon his
breast and she lay limp and motionless in
his arms.</p>

<p>He laid her down, looked long at the white
face, fixed and ghastly in the moonlight.
Then he felt himself seized once more with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
that sick horror which had taken possession
of him once before that evening. As he
turned his head away, the boatswain came up,
and looked curiously down at the prostrate
body.</p>

<p>“Why, sir, he’s dead!” cried he.</p>

<p>Tregenna nodded.</p>

<p>“Leave—him lying there—till morning!”
stammered he.</p>

<p>And as he spoke, he replaced his cloak, as
he had promised Ann that he would do, upon
her quiet limbs.</p>

<p>It was a moment of intense horror for him:
although the passion the woman had felt, or
professed to feel for him had left him almost
cold, it was impossible not to be moved by
the sight of that form, which he had seen so
full of life and fire and energy, cold and still
at his feet.</p>

<p>He could not shake off the chilly feeling of
having held converse with a creature of weird
and supernatural attributes. Even when he
retired to rest, leaving a sailor to watch by the
corpse till morning, the thought of the woman
and her strange end haunted him, would not
let him rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span></p>

<p>It was long before he slept, and his slumber
was disturbed by many an uneasy dream.</p>

<p>When he awoke, in the early morning light,
there was a good deal of commotion on deck.
On going to see what was the matter, he found
that the body of Ann Price, alias “Jem Bax,”
had disappeared.</p>

<p>At first the man who had been left in the
position of watcher professed to know nothing
about the strange disappearance. But, upon
being questioned with some shrewdness by
Tregenna, he confessed that a small boat had
come alongside about two hours before daybreak,
with a couple of men whom he did
not know, who asked what had become of
“Jem.”</p>

<p>With a sailor’s superstition, he had been
only too glad to tell them of what had happened,
and to let them carry away the body in
their boat, still covered with Tregenna’s cloak.</p>

<p>The last he had seen of them was that, in
the gray dawn, they had reached the shore,
and landed their silent burden with difficulty
on the beach, when the tide was out and the
rocks lay bare and cold in the morning mist.</p>

<h2 id="Ch_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent center small">A VERY WOMAN.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">It</span> was with strangely mixed feelings that
Tregenna heard this story of the carrying away
of the body of “Jem Bax,” the smuggler.
Knowing, as he did, that it was a woman who
had been thus borne across the water to her
last resting-place, and with the memory of
that farewell interview strong upon him, he
was stirred, in spite of himself, by the thought
of that swift and silent passage across the
water to the shore; and he seemed to be able
to see, as he strained his eyes in the cold
morning light, the smugglers’ boat with its
quiet burden, gliding over the gray sea to the
dim line of rocks and foam which marked the
edge of the shore.</p>

<p>The sloop had disappeared.</p>

<p>Later in the day the lieutenant went ashore,
and lost no time in making his way to the
parsonage, as usual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span></p>

<p>To his surprise and dismay, he was informed
by old Nance, who opened the door to him,
that Miss Joan had gone away that very morning.</p>

<p>“Gone away!” repeated Tregenna, in stupefaction.
“But whither?”</p>

<p>“That’s more’n I can tell you, sir,” grumbled
Nance, who seemed in an ill-humor, as if
resenting her own position of ignorance. “But
if you’ll step in, maybe the master’ll be able
to tell you more.”</p>

<p>So Tregenna went into the little dining-parlor,
where he found the good vicar looking
rather gloomy.</p>

<p>“Hey-day!” cried Parson Langney, as soon
as the young man entered, “what’s this thou
hast been about, Harry, to disturb thy sweetheart’s
peace as thou hast done?”</p>

<p>“I disturb her peace!” exclaimed Tregenna.
“Nay, sir, I know not. I parted with her but
last night the best of friends, as indeed you
very well know, since it was here I passed
the evening!”</p>

<p>“Well, she’s taken herself away, this morning,
to her aunt’s at Hastings, and charged me
not to tell you how to find the house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span></p>

<p>“But, sir, how know you that I am the
cause of this freak?”</p>

<p>“Aye freak you may well call it, as indeed
I told her myself. But she is as stubborn and
as proud as can be on this matter, and all she
would say was that no man was worth a
thought, save her old father, and she begged
me give her a few days away, to collect herself,
ere she wrote to tell you you must see
her no more!”</p>

<p>The lieutenant, whose limbs were shaking
very much, sat down quietly, with his head
spinning round. What cause of offense he
could have given Joan, to induce her to treat
him in this apparently heartless manner, he
had not the remotest notion. The parson easily
perceived how bewildered he was, and presently
he said—</p>

<p>“’Twas after a visit from poor Gardener
Tom, who came to the door after breakfast
this morning, that she flew into so great a
passion. She would not tell me what he said,
save that no man was to be trusted by any
woman. Does that give you any clue to her
behavior?”</p>

<p>“Gardener Tom!” echoed Tregenna, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
first without an idea as to any connection between
the smuggler’s visit and Joan’s abrupt
departure.</p>

<p>“Had it naught to do with your conduct
towards another woman, think you?” suggested
Parson Langney, watching him with keen eyes.
“It was at the same time that Tom told us
of the death of poor Ann Price.”</p>

<p>At the mention of the name Tregenna started
up.</p>

<p>“What did he tell her about that?” asked
he quickly.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the vicar, with meaning. “Then
it had something to do with that, eh?”</p>

<p>“Surely, surely, sir, Joan has too much
sense, too much generosity, to be angry with
me for showing kindness towards a dying
woman!” cried the young man, with fire.</p>

<p>“Nay,” said the parson, “I know not. A
lass is a strange creature: how far did thy
kindness go, Harry?”</p>

<p>Tregenna frowned. It flashed across his
mind now that perhaps one of the smugglers’
boats had been hovering about the cutter at
the time of Ann’s death, unnoticed in the excitement
and commotion caused by the return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
of the boats’ crews and the capture of a prisoner.
If this were so, and if Gardener Tom
had been one of the occupants, it was very possible
that he had seen the kiss Tregenna had
given the dying woman, and that he had recounted
the incidents of that passionate farewell
of hers to Joan.</p>

<p>Since Tom was jealous himself, it was not
likely that he would let the story lose in the
telling. This seemed the only possible explanation
of Joan’s strange flight, and it was a
most disquieting one.</p>

<p>“’Tis true I did kiss her, sir, at her request,”
said Tregenna, after a short pause. “But
there was never a kiss given in this world that
was less cause for jealousy!”</p>

<p>“Well, I believe you, Harry, for I know you
to be most truly attached to my daughter. But
whether she will believe, is another question.
A woman looks not at these things with a man’s
eyes, nor does she listen to the recital of them
with a man’s ears.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Tregenna, proudly, “I hope she
will come round to a sensible state within a few
days, and send me some message to say so. For
otherwise I will not humble myself to write<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
and demand one. I could not trust the discretion
of a woman who would show so little
confidence in her lover!”</p>

<p>“Nay, let not your spirit carry you too far, or
maybe you’ll lose her altogether!” said the
vicar. “And I would not have that; for though
I would fain have kept my daughter with me
a little longer, had it been possible, I should
not hope to find for her an honester man than
I believe you to be!”</p>

<p>“’Twill be the cruelest loss I have ever
known, if I do lose her,” answered Tregenna,
with emotion. “But yet I shall have no choice
if she is so hard as to let me go without one
word!”</p>

<p>“You will not take with you the name of
the house where her aunt resides?” suggested
Parson Langney, wistfully.</p>

<p>“No, sir. Let her send me a message, or I
will not go to her!” retorted Tregenna. “I
intrude, sir. You are engaged upon your sermon,
I see. Let me wish you a good day!”</p>

<p>And with a bow, and an air of great spirit,
the young man left the house.</p>

<p>Hard though it was to be stern and constant
to his determination, Tregenna kept his word.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
He did not call again at the Parsonage, nor did
he attempt to find out the address of Joan’s
aunt. But he did certainly wander pretty frequently,
in the course of the next few days,
both in the direction of Hurst and of the town
of Hastings, not without a secret hope that he
would meet his offended sweetheart.</p>

<p>He felt that he had a right to consider himself
aggrieved, since she was condemning him
unheard. But at the same time, his glances
towards the Parsonage grew more and more
wistful as the days went by, and he still received
no letter, no message. Had the vindictive
and merciless Ann done him an injury
in death greater than any she had tried to do
him in life? It seemed so; and the lieutenant,
though he assumed a more and more jaunty
air as the time passed, hid a heart of lead underneath.</p>

<p>It was on the fourth day after the morning,
when Ann’s body had been so mysteriously
conveyed away, nobody knew whither, that
Tregenna, on arriving at the village one morning,
found the inhabitants all astir with some
great excitement. They were congregating in
groups about one particular cottage in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
village; and on inquiry as to the reason, he
learnt that it was the day of Ann Price’s funeral
and that they were waiting for the body to be
brought out.</p>

<p>Tregenna lingered, on hearing this, and
hoped that he might have an opportunity of
meeting Tom, and of questioning him as to the
mischief he had done.</p>

<p>When the coffin, covered with a deep black
pall, was brought out of the house, however,
the lieutenant found no one he recognized
among the four bearers.</p>

<p>They were all rough-looking men, of the
rather sinister type he had begun to know so
well, but neither Bill Plunder, nor Robin
Cursemother, Ben the Blast, Jack Price, nor
Gardener Tom, was among them.</p>

<p>“How comes it her brother is not one of the
bearers?” asked he of a bystander.</p>

<p>“Sure, sir, ’tis you should know the reason
of that better than anybody,” returned the
woman, saucily.</p>

<p>For the person of the lieutenant was now
well known in the neighborhood, and there
was a sort of lively warfare carried on between
him on the one side, and the women of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
place, with their free-trading sympathies, on
the other.</p>

<p>By this time the little procession had started
towards the churchyard, and Tregenna, bare-headed,
joined it on its way.</p>

<p>Slowly they went, past the few remaining
houses of the village, and up the hill where the
Parsonage stood. The church, a weather-beaten
little structure, innocent of any sort of restoration
except whitewash, stood beyond, on a
somewhat lower level, and nearer to the marsh.</p>

<p>Under the building, at the east end of the
church, there was a vault, which had belonged
to the family at Rede Hall for nearly a century.
The way to it was by a flight of worn steps,
damp, uneven and overgrown with weeds, behind
the east window.</p>

<p>Here the vicar stood, with the great key of
the vault in his hand, waiting for the arrival of
the solemn little procession.</p>

<p>Very weird, very awe-inspiring it seemed to
Tregenna—the brief service held in the keen
frosty air, under the lee of the old church,
whose stones had been gray and old before the
ancient Faith gave place to the new. There
was a dead calm that day over land and sea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
and the sea-birds flew inland, screaming, over
the brown fields.</p>

<p>A strange contrast all the calm, the peace
seemed to make, to the image of fire and passion,
restless energy and feverish struggle
which was called up by the name of Ann.</p>

<p>When the service was over, and the coffin
had been locked away in the great bare vault,
Tregenna left the rest of the company, and
took a straight cut across the cliffs towards the
Hastings road.</p>

<p>It was with no definite object of going in the
direction of Joan’s present residence, yet there
was doubtless some thought of her hovering in
his mind; so that when, at a distance of some
mile and a half from Hurst, he came suddenly
face to face with her at a turning in the road,
he flushed indeed, but without much surprise,
as if the person who had been in his thoughts
had become on the instant present to him in
the flesh.</p>

<p>She was in the company of a stout country
lass, who was carrying a parcel under her
cloak.</p>

<p>Tregenna bowed, but, except for the space of
half a second, did not stop. And in return for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
the slightly resentful, cold and distant curtsey
she gave him, he held his head very high in
the air, and looked her full in the face with a
defiant expression.</p>

<p>Perceiving this, Joan went suddenly white;
and as he went on, she presently halted, and
turned to look after him. Now, it happened
that Tregenna, although he had made up his
mind that he would not be guilty of such a
weakness, did in his turn stop and give a hasty
glance back at her.</p>

<p>Joan, seeing that he instantly went on again,
could bear it no longer; he should not go like
that, without knowing how little she cared. So
she hastily bade her companion walk on, saying
that she would overtake her shortly; and
then she called, in a haughty and distant tone—</p>

<p>“Mr. Tregenna!”</p>

<p>And of course he had not gone far enough
not to hear her.</p>

<p>He turned, however, in the most leisurely
way possible, and walked back with a very
lofty air of doing something he was much disinclined
to do.</p>

<p>“Madam,” said he, when he had come quite
near, “you called to me, I believe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span></p>

<p>“I did, sir,” said Joan, in a tone as lofty as
his own. “I did but wish to ask you—whether
the stage-wagon has passed this way.”</p>

<p>“I have not seen it, madam,” replied he,
more superbly than ever.</p>

<p>“I thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>She dropped him a stately, dignified curtsey,
to which he responded with a profound bow.
Then he turned again and resumed his walk.
This was more than Joan could bear.</p>

<p>“How can you, Harry?” burst from her
lips.</p>

<p>“Nay, ’tis I should ask that!” retorted
Tregenna, who was back again by her side in
a moment. “’Tis I should want to know how
a woman can treat her lover as you have
treated me this last five days!”</p>

<p>“They told me—they told me——” stammered
Joan, who was now in tears.</p>

<p>He interrupted her quickly.</p>

<p>“Nay, then, if you are content to quarrel
with me on account of what others tell you,
without a word to me, ’tis time we should
bid each other farewell, madam!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Harry, you are too hard, too cruel!
And when ’tis your fault, all your fault! For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
Tom saw you with—with—her in your arms!
You kissed her, once, twice, thri-i-i-ce! And—and
when you told me you cared not for
her! Nay, sir!” She drew herself erect,
and looked at him with a challenge in her
eyes.</p>

<p>“Deny it if you can. You know you dare
not, you cannot!”</p>

<p>“Most certainly I do not deny that I held
Ann Price in my arms, nor that I did kiss
her, as you say. And, if you hold that I did
wrongly in suffering the caprice of a dying
woman, why, madam, I must tell you that ’tis
you that err, not I.”</p>

<p>“But—but—but she had sworn you should
kiss her!” whimpered Joan, falteringly.
“Gardener Tom told me so.”</p>

<p>“Madam, could I help that? She was sick
to death, as you know. Whether ’twas for affection,
which I doubt, or for spite, or for some
other motive, I could do naught but that which
I did. I will neither deny the action, nor
excuse myself for it: since there was naught
to be done but humor her.”</p>

<p>Joan looked at him through her tears; but
although she still endeavored to maintain her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
cold and haughty demeanor, it was plain both
that she was longing to find some way of getting
out of the position she had taken up, and
that she was rejoiced at seeing her lover again.
Tregenna, on his side, was just as feverishly
happy in this meeting as she, and just as eager
to go on with the quarrel, if that were the only
way of holding converse with her.</p>

<p>She uttered another sob.</p>

<p>“I thought you cared for me!” sighed she.</p>

<p>“Madam, I thought I did also.”</p>

<p>“But I see plainly you do not!”</p>

<p>“Nay, madam, then your eyes are keen to
see the thing which is not!”</p>

<p>“If—if you cared for me, you would have
been to visit me—while I was at my aunt’s!”</p>

<p>“If you had cared for me, you would not
have gone away!”</p>

<p>“Then this is to be farewell indeed, sir?”</p>

<p>“If such is your pleasure, madam!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Harry, you are too, too cruel!”</p>

<p>“And you,” whispered Tregenna, his tone
suddenly melting to tenderness, as he seized
her in his arms, “are too foolish, my dear!
Come, dry your eyes and confess that never
had a maiden so little cause to doubt her lover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
as you! Oh, Joan, Joan, and I thought you
were so wise, so sober-minded a person! I
never guessed you were subject to caprices,
like other women! I’m disappointed in you,
Joan.”</p>

<p>“Will you swear,” said Joan, in a tremulous
voice, “you had never any thoughts of love for
her, but only for me?”</p>

<p>“I will swear it again, as I have sworn before.
But you should not doubt me, Joan!”</p>

<p>She was looking rather ashamed of herself,
and it was easy to see that it would be no difficult
matter to convince her of his truth.</p>

<p>“’Twas only,” said she meekly, “that all men
say she was so resistless a creature—that no
man could stand against her wiles. But I’ll be
content, so you assure me with your own lips
you loved her not, but were kind to her out of
pity!”</p>

<p>Tregenna did give her assurance with his
lips, in very impressive fashion. And they
walked back together to Hurst, where Parson
Langney, espying them from his gate while
they were yet at some distance, greeted them
with derisive roars of laughter.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay,” said he. “What a flighty, wayward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
creature is a lover, male or female! If
sober married folk did fly off at a tangent like
to sweethearts in their courting, there would
be never a household on the earth with both
master and mistress within its doors at the
same time!”</p>

<p>“Wherefore are you not busy with your
sermon, father?” asked Joan, saucily, to turn
the conversation and draw attention from her
guilty blushes.</p>

<p>“’Tis too early in the week,” retorted the
vicar, with a twinkle of his merry eyes. “I
was going to the churchyard to look for the key
of the vault I opened this morning. I know
not how I can have mislaid it.”</p>

<p>They accompanied him on his search, but
their efforts were in vain; and at last Tregenna
suggested that the key might have been
stolen.</p>

<p>“Nay, but who should steal the key of a
burial vault?” objected the vicar, incredulously.
“’Tis the last thing a man would covet,
I imagine.”</p>

<p>But though Tregenna did not press the point,
the notion he had suggested did not leave his
mind. And even after he had had tea with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
Joan and her father, and had started on his way
back to his vessel, it recurred to him again and
again.</p>

<p>So that at last he stopped short, turned back,
and made his way once more to the churchyard.</p>

<h2 id="Ch_XX">CHAPTER XX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent center small">THE FREE-TRADERS’ FAREWELL.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">What</span> if one of Ann’s friends, her poor lover
Tom for instance, had stolen the key of the
vault, in order to be able to pass an hour by the
coffin which held the remains of one who had
been so dear to him?</p>

<p>This seemed so likely, that Tregenna was resolved
to put his notion to the test. But he
found the door of the vault safely locked, and
no signs about of any recent visitor.</p>

<p>As, however, on the following day, the vicar
confessed that the key had not yet been discovered,
Tregenna made up his mind to keep
an eye on the church; and he regularly, for the
next ten days, paid a visit to the spot before
returning to the cutter after his call at the
Parsonage.</p>

<p>And on the tenth evening, just as he was entering
the churchyard by the little wooden gate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
on the north side, he caught sight of a human
head disappearing rapidly, apparently into the
bowels of the earth, behind the east end of the
church.</p>

<p>Going rapidly and noiselessly in that direction,
Tregenna reached the steps which led
down to the vault, and saw that the door was
open some inches. Descending cautiously, he
could distinguish certain sounds within the
vault, which betrayed the presence of live human
beings; the mutterings and shufflings of
feet grew louder, until he was able to distinguish
the voice of Jack Price the smuggler, and
another which he did not recognize.</p>

<p>After the lapse of a few seconds they began
to make such a noise, as they pushed certain
heavy loads about, to the accompaniment of
much scraping of the stone floor, that Tregenna
ventured to open the door a little farther, and
to peep in.</p>

<p>A weird sight met his eyes. By the light of
a torch, which smoked and flared, throwing a
red light on the faces and figures of the men,
and making a great patch of sooty blackness
upon the green slime on the roof, Jack Price,
long, lean, and woebegone of face, and Bill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
Plunder, short, crooked, and evil-looking, were
busily engaged in piling up against the walls of
the vault a huge quantity of kegs and bales of
goods, in order to make them occupy the least
possible space, and so make room for more.</p>

<p>Tregenna, hardened as he was to the smugglers
and their villainies, could scarcely believe
his eyes. Not a sign of a coffin was to be seen.
Apparently the dead had been turned out of
their resting-place, to make way for the merchandise
of the “free-traders.”</p>

<p>As he thought of the callousness which could
thus make an opportunity out of the death of
an old comrade like Ann, to find a new nest
for their contraband wares, the lieutenant felt
that he could restrain himself no longer. Casting
all prudence to the winds, and unmindful
of the fact that these two might have comrades
within call, he dashed open the door of the
vault, and seizing the tall Jack Price, by a
clever movement flung him sprawling on the
stone floor.</p>

<p>Bill Plunder, though taken aback for the
moment, recovered himself, and planting himself
behind a breastwork of contraband merchandise,
leveled his pistol at Tregenna.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span></p>

<p>The lieutenant whipped out his own weapon
at the same moment, received a bullet in
his right shoulder, and answered by firing with
his left a shot which made Bill leap up in the
air with a loud cry. The next moment Tregenna
found himself grappling with Jack, who
had risen from the ground and seized a broken
piece of metal which was lying on the stone
floor.</p>

<p>Jack fought like a madman, slashing and
plunging at his opponent with a vigor and
ferocity which seemed to render the combat a
hopeless one for the lieutenant, whose wound
was bleeding freely, when, just as Tregenna
felt his head growing dizzy and his eyes becoming
dim, the smuggler, in making a desperate
lunge at him, tripped in some ropes
which were lying on the floor, and stumbled
headlong over a couple of the smuggled kegs
of spirit.</p>

<p>Quick as thought Tregenna seized one of
the kegs, sprang to the door, got outside, and
wedged the door tightly with the barrel, which
he had rolled out in front of him.</p>

<p>The space at the bottom of the steps was
just wide enough to allow of this being done;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
and then, without waiting to see whether the
men would make any attempt to escape from
their imprisonment, he started for the Parsonage.</p>

<p>Before he got there, however, he found himself
staggering, and knew that he would not
have strength left to reach the house. As
he stood swaying to and fro for a few seconds
on the footpath, he caught the sound of a
wagon going along slowly at the foot of the
hill. There was a man walking beside the
horses, cracking his whip and urging them on.
It was too dark for Tregenna to see either
wagon or man; but the frosty air carried the
sounds to him clearly, and carried back his
fainting cry—</p>

<p>“Help, help!”</p>

<p>Then he fell down on the grass beside the
footpath.</p>

<p>When he came to himself, after a curious
experience of being in the sea, swimming for
life, with a dozen faces he knew around him,
he found that he was still lying on the grass,
but that there was at least one face he knew
bending over him, looking very weird and
strange by the light of a heavy lantern, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
had been placed on the ground beside him.
And the face was that of Gardener Tom!</p>

<p>“Tom?” cried he faintly.</p>

<p>The great boorish fellow watching over him
burst into a great blubbering and sobbing like
an overgrown child.</p>

<p>“Ay, ’tis me, sir, and glad am I to see you
look at me again. For oons, sir, I thought
you’d shut your eyes forever! You’re hurt,
sir—badly hurt. And for sure ’tis one of them
rascally smugglers that’s done it!”</p>

<p>Ill as he was, Tregenna smiled and raised his
eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Smugglers, Tom! Nay, sure you mean
‘free-traders.’”</p>

<p>“I means <i>smugglers</i>, domn ’em!” roared
Tom, energetically. “And if ever I carry a
keg again, or help ’em in their wicked ways,
may I be riddled through and through, loike as
if I was a target!”</p>

<p>“Since—when have you—become so virtuous?”
panted out Tregenna feebly.</p>

<p>“Since one of ’em, nay two of ’em served
me a dirty trick, sir,” answered Tom, fiercely.
“Ask me no more, sir; for sure I don’t want
for to let out what I’ve in my moind!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span></p>

<p>“How long—have I lain here?”</p>

<p>“Not more’n the space of half a minute, sir.
And no more you mustn’t. I be going for to
call them at the Parsonage.”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, Tom, I should alarm them, in
this plight.”</p>

<p>“Never fear for that, sir. It would alarm
’em more for you to die!”</p>

<p>And Tom hobbled away in the direction of
the vicar’s house at a great rate.</p>

<p>As he lay there in the cold air, Tregenna
was vaguely conscious of a feeling of satisfaction
that Gardener Tom had turned to
honest ways. And then his mind began to
wander again. He was recalled to full consciousness
by a delicious sense of ease and
peace, and by feeling the touch of the hand
he loved the best in the world on his forehead.</p>

<p>A few minutes afterwards he was lying on
a hastily made bed in the vicarage parlor.</p>

<p>Tregenna lay ill for some weeks; for the
wound inflicted by Bill’s bullet was a serious
one, and he had lost so much blood before he
was discovered by Tom, that there was a fear
lest he might not be able to stand the drain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span></p>

<p>Thanks to the tender nursing he received,
however, at Joan’s loving hands, he presently
began to mend. And it was when all danger
was past that he learnt the fate of the two
smugglers whom he had imprisoned in the
vault beneath the church.</p>

<p>Jack Price had managed to escape, but had
had the misfortune to run straight into the
arms of the brigadier and his soldiers, who
now patrolled the country round Hurst with
more assiduity than before. Being recognized
as one of the most prominent of the smugglers,
he was seized, carried to Rye, and
hanged within a fortnight; for such offenders
as he had scant shrift in those times.</p>

<p>Bill Plunder was found dead in the vault,
having been killed by the shot Tregenna had
fired at him in exchange for his own.</p>

<p>An enormous quantity of smuggled goods
which had been secreted in the vault, were
confiscated by the authorities: for even Squire
Waldron had begun to see that his reign of
laxity was over.</p>

<p>Not a sign of the coffins was to be found,
however; and a thrill of horror ran through
every one at the thought that the smugglers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
had even got rid of these in order to make
way for more plunder.</p>

<p>A deep peace seemed to fall over the whole
neighborhood after the death of Jack Price
and Bill Plunder. The brigadier flattered
himself that he should get promotion for his
energy, and Tregenna felt that his task was
done, and that the time was convenient for
the retirement he had promised the vicar.</p>

<p>So fully satisfied were the authorities in
London that the mission of soldiers and revenue-men
had been thoroughly and effectively
accomplished, that the brigade was
shortly withdrawn from the neighborhood, and
the cutter was sent to another part of the coast.</p>

<p>It was not until after his withdrawal from
the service, when the snowdrops were peeping
above the ground, that Tregenna came down
to Hurst, and put up at the best inn, ready
for his marriage with Joan on the morrow.
It was to have been a very quiet wedding;
but Joan had made herself so much beloved
in the countryside that, long before the time
for the ceremony had arrived, the whole
churchyard and the grass round were thick
with a dense throng of people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span></p>

<p>Gardener Tom was there with a huge nosegay
of hothouse flowers, speaking loudly his
hatred and detestation of the whole sex, with
the exception of Miss Joan.</p>

<p>Squire Waldron and Bertram were there, in
smart hunt colors, waiting to welcome the
bride.</p>

<p>The ladies from Hurst Court were there,
simpering and wondering how the vicar’s
daughter could be so selfish as to leave her
father! They wouldn’t have done it, not
they!</p>

<p>Men, women, and children from Hurst and
the villages round were there with their snowdrops,
to strew on the path before sweet
Mistress Joan.</p>

<p>All was peace, and brightness, and happiness;
and the winter sun came out in her
honor as blushing Joan, tall and handsome, in
her plain white dress and veil, came from the
Parsonage, leaning on her father’s arm.</p>

<p>The service was over; the blessing had
been spoken on the young people, and Tregenna
was leading his bride down the little
aisle, when a sound reached the ears of all present
which froze the blood of some of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span></p>

<p>It was a peal of loud, mocking laughter, in
a well-known voice.</p>

<p>It came into the church from the wide
porch, and echoed through the building.</p>

<p>“Ann!” cried Tregenna, under his breath.</p>

<p>“No, no, not Ann; but Jem Bax!” cried
the well-known voice, in clear and ringing
tones.</p>

<p>And into the bright light of the doorway
strode Ann, in her lad’s dress, with a keg
slung in front and one behind, in approved
smuggler fashion.</p>

<p>“Heaven bless you both, for a pair of innocent
lambs,” she cried, raising one hand as if
in benediction. “See, Ben, do not they make
a monstrous pretty pair? Prettier than you
and me, when they made us one!”</p>

<p>And the burly form of Ben the Blast, with
his kegs slung over his shoulder, came into
view behind her.</p>

<p>Everybody was too much taken aback, too
much amazed at the deception Ann had practised,
and at her unflagging audacity, to attempt
to touch either her or the smuggler at
her side. With another laugh and a wave of
the hand, they both left the church porch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
sprang on the back of a stout horse which
was waiting at the gate, and were away over
the marsh to the new haunt they had made,
before Tregenna had had time to recover his
wits.</p>

<p>He had done with her, forever; but there
was still trouble in store for the representatives
of law and order, while the daring,
wicked spirit walked the earth in the flesh.</p>

<p>“Are you jealous still, Joan?” whispered
Tregenna, in his bride’s ear.</p>

<p>“No. But—I’m thankful she’s married,
Harry,” was the fervent answer.</p>

<p>“And I,” returned Tregenna with equal
fervor, “am thankful ’tis no longer my duty
to cope with her and her tricks. For, faith, I
believe she’s in league with the very powers
of darkness!”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
